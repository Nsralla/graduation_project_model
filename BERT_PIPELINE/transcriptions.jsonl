On the one hand, we should not always ban on our parents, who have sacrificed a lot for us. As a matter of fact, we have enough capacity to earn a living by ourselves. Having a part-time job is a good way to make a profit. On the other hand, college students can improve their abilities by doing part-time jobs. If a college student has a part-time job, he will know different people, which may do him a favor in the future. There is no doubt that someone who has worked or experienced can be employed by companies more easily. In addition, college students have more spare time compared to students in middle schools. They should spare their spare time on minimum wage."}

Second, it's a good opportunity to practice your abilities. Your abilities in many ways, such as speaking, doing, horse work, or managing. The third one is it's a bridge to the world outside.

Significant work experience along with good references prove the potential employers that you have the basic qualities which make a good employee. Second, having a part-time job will help students financially. Taking on financial responsibility takes some of the load of their parents. Parents will not be around forever, and so students have to gradually become responsible for all of their own expenses. Third, keeping a part-time job has been learned to budget and handling money.

Secondly, having a part-time job paves the way for us to face society, letting us know how to be a social man in advance, and encouraging us to start harder to face the challenge.

What's more, they can put what they have learned into practice.

For others, their family is rich and the part-time job is an opportunity to exercise their social ability for other students to study in class with none of their life. They should learn more from other classes and other classes they can take part in many activities. A part-time job is considered an opportunity because the study still is very important. So if one student can have more time and energy, I think they should think about more to have a part-time job."}

As I see it, there are both benefits and drawbacks for college students taking a part-time job. On the one hand, in addition to gaining an income, college students taking a part-time job can enjoy a more exciting lifestyle, as they can meet people from all walks of life and develop a sense of responsibility which can be learned in the classroom. On the other hand, students who take a part-time job may have less time focused on study, and if they seek excel in both the part-time job and study, the people they meet may improve their health at a speed.

First, from the material point of view, as we see at the Ministry of Education has made a further adjustment of college tuition, part-time jobs will drop terribly as an economic burden for those not for rich families. Second, with the shortcomings of China's exam-oriented education, most of the students cannot communicate with others or confront difficulties alone in society. Part-time jobs can make them adjusted to society gradually, and I think we should have part-time jobs experience in the whole college."}

On the one hand, we should not always depend on our parents who have sacrificed a lot for us. As a matter of fact, we have enough capacity to earn a living by ourselves. Having a part-time job is a good way to make a profit. On the other hand, college students can improve their abilities by doing part-time jobs. If a college student has a part-time job, he will know different people which may do him a favor in the future. There is no doubt that someone who has work experience can be employed by companies more easily. In addition, college students have more spare time compared to students in middle schools who should spend their spare time on multiple things rather than on entertainment. As a college student, I firmly believe that we can benefit from having a part-time job. So we should do."}

If they do part-time jobs, they can buy what they want or buy what their parents want.

Smoking in the public office may cause hatred between non-smokers and smokers. So I think it is absolute that smoking should be banned completely."}

I think it is a respect to the individual freedom, so I disagree to prohibit smoking in the public place. For example, if a person feels upset, they will have the way to have the stress come out, come out or come off."}

Secondly, especially for public areas, smoking is no longer a private thing but something will harm the welfare of others around.

On the other hand, smoking causes errors. Just imagine that you're sitting in a restaurant full of smoke. How can you enjoy your meal there? Besides, smoking is bad for the average of countries in the world. I believe if smoking is banned in all the public places, most of us will breathe in more fresh and clean air.

In fact, everyone must respect other people's feelings and we have to cooperate with each other. I think there can be some smoking rooms along the street for smokers, but smoking at restaurants should be banned.

The second would be to gain extra money. And the third one would be trying to do something out of the comfort zone. So for the first one, to gain more exposure. Students have been doing this thing throughout their lives for around 20 years, and they should get to know more about the society and to have more exposure, rather than studying. And the second reason is that to get more money. Because I think it's very important for college students to establish the idea of financial management.

They can also step into the society quicker and learn about the society and use the process into the society in the future.

It is important for college students to find their part-time jobs to earn more money if they want to portray and have more activities because college students are others so they actually have the ability to earn money but not rely so much on their parents. Secondly, I think finding the part-time jobs can let their college students learn more about the time management so they can learn how to strike a balance between studies and part-time jobs.

For example, having gatherings with friends or studying or getting a part-time job. So when we have a choice, I think that we should get a part-time job.

For example, the interaction with different age groups and the actual experiences of living in a society and the reality. So, I think having a part-time for a college student is very important.

Before graduation, I'm already in debt for more than $20,000. And, therefore, working as a part-time job can make me save money and be more able to pay for my tuition fee, and at the same time be less reliant on my family. And the second reason is that taking a part-time job can enable students to learn more experiences before working in society when they graduate, because working a part-time job, you can learn communication skills, interpersonal skills, as well as human skills.

And when the people keep smoking around, because the smoke basically goes around in the air, so you have no other method to avoid the smoke. You don't have anything to separate you from the smoke. So you are like having a secondhand smoking. And I think it really affects one's health. So I think it should really be banned in all restaurants in the country. So yeah, basically I agree with the statement."}
{"filename": "SM_HKG_SMK2_045_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " To ban smoking in our country and also in the restaurant, I think that's a good idea. Because maybe it's harmful to human bodies. Some of the ingredients in cigarettes are actually very bad for health. For example, they have the proteins and tar, which causes you to get addicted to smoking and also those ingredients will increase the chance of getting lung cancer or other kinds of respiratory diseases. So I think to ban smoking is generally good for the public. But then I doubt the efficiency about implementing this issue because it seems that many people are now smoking at that age. So there have been already a big difference."}

For some smokers, they definitely disagree with this idea because they think it is their right to smoke in restaurants and open areas. It is their freedom. So if we ban them from smoking in these places, we suppress their freedom. But I totally disagree because smokers only account for a minority of the people and for most of us, the majority. Smoking definitely has more disadvantage to our health. And also smokers can still smoke in their homes, so they do not need to smoke in restaurants. And also I think banning smoking can help smokers to get rid of their problems."}
{"filename": "SM_HKG_SMK2_047_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " I don't think we should ban smoking because although smoking is bad for our health, it is not as bad as other drugs. If you ban it, people will think that the seriousness is just the same as with other things. And you will not really stop them from smoking cigarettes because they are addictive and it's really hard to get rid of it. They will find other substances and they will think that, oh, I'm doing something illegal anyway, so why not try it, which will make me more excited. And this will lead to more serious drug abuse. So I don't think we should ban smoking, maybe we should try to invent some stuff to do that will not cause a bad effect, like not as bad as cigarettes, like some maybe electronic cigarettes."}
{"filename": "SM_HKG_SMK2_048_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, there is health concerns. Smoking may cause harmful effects to both smokes, like who gets cigarettes and the substance inside, like nicotine or carbon dioxide, and it causes lung cancer that is very obvious. Besides, it's restaurants. They're all closed areas. So secondhand smoke may also affect the people or the diners around you. And secondhand smoke claims to be even more harmful to people, which they believe in secondhand smoking. And besides the food, you eat in restaurants. You're supposed to be eating and the smoke gets into your food. It will be so disgusting and not really hygienic enough. So it's both harmful to your health and also to the atmosphere in the restaurants."}

The environment is already quite bad to our health because it contains a lot of poisonous or harmful compounds which will damage our health. If many people smoke and many of these harmful chemicals enter the environment, this will further harm our health and also those animals or trees that live around us. That is a bad behavior to the environment. Every person should be responsible for the environment we live in and to conserve it so our next generation can also live in an environment which would not bring any harm to them. I think this is a very strong argument. So for some I think smoking is bad."}

Those who favor this notion believe that part-time jobs can better train the youngster about practical life. Part-time jobs can also help meeting financial needs of students. However, to some extent, part-time jobs have an adverse effect on the education of the individual as they lose concentration on their studies. I am in favor of part-time jobs for students. Students will have to start their practical life eventually to earn their bread and butter. Those who are having the job somehow still can develop the positive attitude towards work-space, being able to motion hard work, responsibility, and commitment better than others, which will play a vital role in securing a good job and far better."}

The time of their studies is also disturbed. They have to pay their time to the job as well. So we can say that part-time job is not necessary for the students.

Secondly, if a person does not have strong critical thinking and has poor financial condition, they do part-time jobs with their studies. As we think about positive and negative, in fact, part-time jobs do have some positive and negative things. Positive in a sense, the person can have experience along with their studies. In different people with different concepts and knowledge, as we learn through discussion experience, we learn a lot through this, but it has a negative impact as well.

Some young people have to earn money on their own to pay the tuition while others just earn money to pay for the expenditure or satisfy their desire. Plus, another advantage is that students can acquire more experience and abolish their skills when taking a part-time job. For example, if someone enjoys teaching, working part-time as a tutor, may help him or her improve teaching skills and gain experiences. One on the other hand, there are many disadvantages too. First of all, it is a lack of time for the focus on studies. There is a high possibility that the students will have trouble finding a job."}

A person who does a job for good reasons, for earning money, to get some experiences, for their career opportunities. A person's job is also for good reasons. When a person goes abroad, they don't have much resources to survive. In order to survive, they do part-time jobs along with their service.

Smokers should have their own life, and be good nukes. I think it should be banned because the smoke is very bad for lungs and it's a choice to keep in good health.

And we all know that good grades is a path to getting a rightful job or a job that you dream of. That's why you're here. You're here to study, not to work. And that's why I really disagree that part-time jobs should be required or should be done by college students. I myself do not have a part-time job because I don't believe that this can help us in college. Yes, it will give us extra money, but what cost? Our grades would be degraded."}

I believe that having a part-time job will easily distract them and although some students may have a part-time job, they can handle both, but I suggest that having a part-time job is not necessary for a college student to do something because having a part-time job will only cause the student to distract and the student should enjoy his life as a student because it's not all the time that we are students. Part-time jobs can only be there when the student graduates."}

Unlike studying, which is already a hard task for us students, it will be better, I guess. And another thing is, here in the Philippines, it's quite hard to look for some part-time jobs, especially for us students, because they need a lot of time, and they choose the prestigious schools in their country. And they don't really look for those students who are in need. They often look for students who they know that can do something for them. And I believe that not all students are like that. I guess these students are different. Some have different levels than the others. Even though we're in the same college, or we're in the same level, it's not that hard."}

I mean, admissions rely on outgoing, friendly students to give group tours or even personal tours and talk to potential students about all that the college has to offer. If you think it's a job for you, you should ask your admissions department about the openings. Not only is it a job that looks good on your resume, but it's also convenient because you don't even have to leave campus to get to work. Having to think about work is pretty hard for a college student, but gives them more responsibility. Freshman seminar classes can have as many as 500 students enrolled.

Despite these grants, there are still various requirements one must undergo to finish a college degree in such prominent universities. These include various projects which involve a lot of finances, which I can tell you. A student must have something sustaining him or her. This is where the jobs come in. I believe that college students should have jobs to teach them the responsibility of handling and keeping finances well. College is the last step before entering the world of adulthood.

And as they say, experiences are the best teachers in life, and with that experience they get to learn more. And not only do they get to learn more, they get to gain new lessons in life, and also they get to learn the value of independency.

So a part-time job, it's really helpful to a college student because, first of all, as early as college, it will help them earn money. It will teach them how to use this hard-earned money. It will also help them in their training in college as well because college is about training yourself for working.

It is true before getting a permanent job or a big job, every people should have to get experiences about what they will be doing in the future. When college students have a job, they will earn money. Some of these students need the money to pay for expensive schools, while other students need it to make their life easier. Some college students will not worry about many things in their life such as food, rent, and bills especially if they obtain a lot of money from their job. Some schools are very expensive, even the parent students cannot pay all the fee for these schools. Thus, the students have to obtain a part-time job which would help them to provide money for school fees and for themselves.

If you're a college student looking for a part-time job, the best place to start your job search is right on campus. There are tons of on-campus job opportunities and as a student, you'll automatically be given hiring priority. Plus, on-campus jobs eliminate commuting time and can be a great way to connect with academic and professional resources at your university. Check with your school's career office or student employment office for help finding a campus job. Of course, there are opportunities for part-time work of campus, too.

We know that it has advantages and disadvantages, but we should focus more on the welfare of the student rather than what it can provide for the future, because what it can provide for the future can be done in the classroom, and what the student can do inside the classroom can be boosted up by being well rested and being prepared for the incoming day, and that is by not having a part-time job, which is, you know, a student can focus more on his or her studies. So we should really not push ourselves to do something, because we have our parents do that for us, and then what we can do to make our parents proud is to study well and be an achiever."}

Although if they cannot balance their studies without jobs, then I suggest that students should not get the part-time jobs because it will only cause a distraction and less time for students to study their lessons instead of just focusing. So I think that I have a relative point of view on whether college students should get part-time jobs. So if the student is able to balance his studies, his or her studies, then yes, he or she should get part-time jobs.

Other places in public, because secondhand smoking is really dangerous for people's health. There are a lot of reasons to quit smoking or to ban smoking because of the health risk it gives. There are of course star and nicotine in cigarettes which are substances that can cause cancer and are very addictive. Smoking, as studies have shown, reduces your life expectancy by 7 to 8 years. So I think it is a good reason to ban smoking. Some of the major diseases are also caused by smoking, like cardiovascular diseases."}

I think government should gradually help the smokers to stop smoking by implementing some laws that could discourage smokers in smoking. One example would be the increase of price of cigarettes so that majority of smokers could not be able to afford it anymore. This thing has been legalized in the Philippines.

In fact, lung cancer is included in the most common cancers in the world. Let us be reminded that second-hand smoking is far more dangerous than a first-hand smoking. Others have allergies in smoke or have asthma, so it is possible for just a smoker to be affected, but also the innocent people around him.

The scientists are sure that passive smoking is harmful for our health at the same value. Smoking is affected to our health.

If my restaurant is a closed one, smoking inside would cause the smoke to remain inside the restaurant causing second-hand smoke to other people who come into my restaurant.

For example, in restaurants, some, not everyone inside the restaurant are adults. Some of them are children and if you would smoke in front of a child, I think it is not morally..."}

The health of the smokers here are at stake and each role of the system is very important for the progress and development of our country. And with that, we should all take care not only of our health and condition, but also the condition of the smokers. Second is for the non-smokers, even if they're not smoking, their health is at stake here because they can inhale the smoke that the smokers are releasing. They could be carrying diseases, contagious diseases, and not only the non-smokers could get the disease from the cigarette, but also the disease of the smokers. And third is for the environment. Air pollution is going out of hand right now and I'm pretty sure that cigarettes are a big factor."}

So, when also a person is considering whether he needs a part-time job, it means to say that he needs a certain amount of time, possibly a month or a few months in order to do something apart from perhaps studying or finding a real job. Now, as you know, a part-time job is usually, or rather you can see it as a precursor of a full-time occupation. And what I think is very important is because having a part-time job, by having a part-time job, you give it to experience what it will be like in the future once you start, once you embark on a career in the working world. Now, experiences, they come in many different forms. For example, you get to see how it is like, for example, to wake up early in the morning and to come back home at the end of the day. So naturally, you feel what it is like to spend the entire day out of your house, away from the comfort zone."}

So actually doing part-time work actually ails us, the financial burden on us and also on our parents. And furthermore, we also do not wish to be too financially burdened after we actually graduate so that we can spend more time concentrating on our work rather than paying back the bank loans and also paying back our parents as well. And I also feel that doing part-time work is also a very important way to show how a student can actually manage a multi-class, like how we can juggle with our studies at the same time committing to part-time work.

So we need the money to pay off our tuition loans and so taking a part-time job can help us release the financial burden of our family. And by taking a part-time job, we gain more experience in the working world because we get to interact with colleagues, we get to know how a company runs. So I think that will be some form of valuable experience that we get. So apart from getting the money, we also get the experience from working in a part-time job.

It also teaches you to save your income instead of spending everything in order to save wealth for the future and also it teaches you how to manage your time well because it will satisfy time for a part-time job and it teaches you how to juggle your studies.

Hard skills involve like the meal jobs that you are required to do like cooking and cleaning up, which is very important, because as you grow up and you have to live alone, soft skills include interacting with your colleagues and learning how to communicate. Also, if you provide a service and work in the service industry, you will learn how to interact with customers and how to properly present yourself. In part-time jobs, you are required to go for meetings, you learn about self-presentation, and you also learn about social awareness in terms of how you control the crowd. Next, it gives you industrial exposure of the possible industries that you would like to look into as you grow up and you want to find a proper job in the future."}

I think it is important for students to have a part-time job, mainly because at this age when you are starting tertiary education, you are becoming an adult. And that's when you need to learn how to earn your own expenses. So doing part-time jobs is a good way to do so. And I feel that with part-time jobs, not only do you get to earn money, but you also get to experience what it is like to work. So you are no longer sheltered from your parents, you no longer have your own pocket money. So you experience the sweat and the blood that you earn. So that's one cut."}

For one, I think one of the most important things to think about is the major that you're doing in your college or in your university. What sort of major is it? Say for example, you're doing a science major and you have things like you have to do practicals, you have to be in lab, or you're in a major such as geography where you have a lot of field work that you need to do. So all these additional requirements for your major are really going to take up a lot of time. Do you have the extra time to do a part-time job? But at the same time, you should ask yourself, do you need the financial resources provided by a part-time job?

Although it is good that people take part-time jobs while studying to improve their resume and experiences, but it is not necessary for all people because some people would like the extra time to prepare and study for university because university may be quite tough for them as well. So as a result, if they were to work and take part-time jobs, they might not be able to have sufficient time to study for."}

Some of my friends, they don't take money from their parents anymore and they are actually able to support themselves and in that sense, it's part of growing up and becoming an adult and taking responsibility for yourself and that is very good. On the other hand, we also need to understand that students need some student life in the sense that they need to juggle their academics, they need to juggle their co-curricular activities and by having a part-time job, it may actually affect the amount of time they have on their other activities."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_011_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " Okay, I feel that students should get part-time jobs because firstly, it encourages them to become independent individuals, especially because they are entering university and they have the ability to support themselves if they wanted to. And also, this is a first step towards adulthood and by not taking money from their parents after their parents have raised them for 20 over years, it is a very good time for them to step up and take charge of their financial capabilities. On the other hand, as a student, student life can be fadishy and students need to study, they need to juggle their social life and all that, so it can be quite difficult especially if they take up a part-time job and they want to join the school curriculum. So in that sense, I think it depends on the student whether or not the students are able to juggle with the workload and if they are not able to do so, maybe it's better that they focus just on studying instead because as a student, they are not able to do so."}

Yeah, because especially those who participate a lot, they might not be able to manage their time well enough. However, on the other hand, I agree mostly because you can earn extra cash. You do not have to be dependent on your parents because of this extra money. As well, the student is getting extra money from their parents or his or her parents as well. So with the extra cash, I feel that they will spend their money wisely, like they'll be able to tell what they should spend on and what they should not spend on.

Moreover, we already have CCAs. It's not compulsory, but I would rather a student choose to take part in the CCA rather than holding a part-time job since it's not really part of the curriculum.

So basically when they start to have part-time jobs, they will have their own incomes and most likely they will not be receiving any allowances from their parents.

For instance, if in future after you graduate from college, you have to go for interviews, you have to go for like really interviews where people will, all the judges will actually look out for experience and when you learn to work at part-time jobs, they will actually give you a good exposure to work life so you at least have a general image, general idea of how working life is about."}

Overall, for the general college student population, I do not feel that it's important for college students to have part-time jobs as the priority is to study. However, for some students, having a part-time job would help generate some income. This is helpful as expenditure in college or universities is rather high. We would not want to always depend on our parents. So as such, many of my friends give tuition as it gives good money and the hours taken for each session is not really long. However, I feel that it's good for students to have part-time jobs during the summer vacation."}

I think it's good for them to have a part-time job because like cost of living in Singapore is so high. And a lot of students actually have like side jobs while they study. I have a lot of friends who do that and personally I do that also. Yeah, cost of living is really high so like you have a part-time job like to ease the burden on your parents because like it's really hard, like the money they earn might not be enough or they're like struggling to make a living. And like students usually like have a part-time job to like pay for like their extra things like their clothes and their food. Yeah, and I have a part-time job also like on retracing.

The reason being, firstly, having a part-time job would mean that students get to see a glimpse of what working life is like. They get to experience how it's like to earn their own money and not just depend on their parents for financial aid. This will allow them to be more independent and it will help them to be able to build their working relations skills with others. It also helps them to get a new perspective and idea of what they want to do in the future for their own lives. Whether the part-time job is something that they really want to pursue."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_038_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I agree with the statement that students should find part-time jobs while they are studying. And why I agree is because I think there are several benefits to this. Firstly, it teaches students time management. As for myself, I've done this before. I've worked part-time while studying before and I know how difficult it is to put in 100% both the workplace and the school place. So to be honest, it also gives a great sense of achievement when you have done both well. Also, another benefit is that you start learning how to be independent because in Singapore, most parents would provide an allowance for their children, maybe all the way until university, at least."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_039_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " Okay, so firstly, why college students feel that it's important for college students to have part-time jobs because firstly, they need the experience. This like individuals with a lot of future potential and with respect to my experience, every time we have summer holidays or any kind of holidays or breaks, us law students are encouraged to pick up internships either in the Singapore legal system or industry as well as other private firms so that instead of just learning textbook stuff, we pick up actual life skills which we are going to be using on the job. And then these skills can only be learned through this kind of part-time job since it's not as easy for true-hour textbooks. Secondly, money."}

You need money to further your education, you need to improve your skills, you need to make life more comfortable for yourself. So I feel that with a proper job, after you graduate from university, we have a good life."}

However, in terms of all these skills, I'm sure there are other opportunities to hone and develop all these personal skills. For example, the student could consider joining as a co-curator at Prifidies and taking up perhaps leadership positions. Or he could also consider joining an internship which gives him a more in-depth view into the company or the work that he or she wants to do in the future. And while there are many other opportunities available, it doesn't have to be limited to part-time jobs only because whereas the student isn't able to manage and balance while his part-time job ends."}

I find that as a student, it is better to focus on our own studies. Students should study hard to get a better grade so that they can get a better career when they graduate. However, if a college student faces financial difficulties or distress, then maybe they should start looking for a part-time job. Well, looking for a part-time job is not just about the money. By getting a part-time job, you can also gain invaluable experiences on the job, such as you can pick up scales, you can pick up office skills, you can pick up clinical skills, you can pick up even interpersonal skills when you deal with customers. And this will actually better equip students for the workplace."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_043_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " I think doing a part-time job is something that I would be with and I think that students nowadays should do part-time jobs because when they are growing up they cannot depend fully on their parents to fund their pocket money. And at the same time I think part-time jobs allow students to be able to buy anything that they want without getting folded by their parents because they are spending too much money. It's a sort of income for students to earn extra cash to buy what they need. I guess also for students with financial difficulties, part-time jobs also provides them with an extra source of revenue or income so that they can get a job."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_044_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I personally disagree with the statement because I believe that all college students should be focused on their studies primarily because that is their role as college students. I feel that college students have enough on their hands already with attending lectures and tutorials and completing assignments and doing group projects and also to balance all their studies out with a good campus life. I believe that all these factors would take up quite a bit of time already and that adding the burden of a part-time job might be too strenuous. However, it is important to understand the reason why some people take up part-time jobs as well. For example, some people would need the extra money to pay for their tuition fees or to pay for other living expenses. So in these cases, taking a part-time job is a little bit more important and more justified. However, all in all, I still disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."}

For example, it's important to prepare you for the future in terms of giving you good people skills and good practice to manage one's time even in a busy college schedule. And it also cultivates independence such that students will not be dependent on their parents' funding but will have a source of income for themselves even while they study. However, I believe that it is possible for these benefits to come through a summer school, a summer program internship or a job taken up during the summer holidays which can extend to three to four months which is a substantial amount of time."}

So I believe that getting a part-time job would inculcate a sense of how important money is, inculcate the value of money in these college students so that they're better prepared after graduation because I think oftentimes students who just graduated and started working don't know the value of money.

{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_047_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " Yes, I don't agree that part-time jobs are important, however, they are not a necessity. They are important because it teaches students many things, for example, the value of money. It is very easy to spend money these days, but it's not that easy to earn it. Furthermore, students learn to juggle everything that they have, including studies, friendships, relationships, as well as learning new stuff at their jobs. Furthermore, the experience is really good because of what they learn. This can include interacting with people better, certain skills that they've never learned before, for example, learning to use Excel sheets like my seniors told me. Furthermore, in general, it just gives you really good exposure, especially to the types of people we could meet when we go out there to work. Furthermore, it also allows them to earn money to support themselves through, especially during the holidays, or if they could have a part-time job while they're still studying again."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_048_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " Now, for college students to have part-time jobs, I would have to say I would disagree with such a statement because if they were to have part-time jobs, it will make a compromise on the amount of time that they have to study and or sleep, primarily because during the daytime, private mornings, the afternoon sessions, they will be having classes, but in the evenings and maybe late into the night, they will be working part-time, which would have a detrimental effect on their studying hours and their resting period as well. And for a society like Singapore where there are companies who hire based on your grades, students who work part-time may suffer a lower grade and may start in their position, their academic standing and their academic competency to be neglected."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ1_049_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " Well, to a certain extent, I agree with the statement because nowadays many students can afford to go to college and currently because of globalization, students are able to travel around within their studies and all these take money. So if a student does not do any part-time job and solely depends on their parents for allowance or even expenditure to go overseas, then it will be quite taxing for the parent, especially when they have more than one children. Well, but then again, as students, our main priority should be studying. So having a part-time job actually distracts the students from whatever they are supposed to do properly and it might not be the best course of action for a student who is having examinations or even any other important test, taking any important test."}

Secondly, the short-term benefits, monetary benefits that part-time work gives them does not outweigh the long-term benefits that they could have achieved if they focus on their studies and get a good job and get a good job and get a pay that is higher. Secondly, working also takes up time and energy and it is not easy nowadays to study around the world, especially in Singapore. And like working will take up this time and energy which could have been better dedicated to studies. Like the opportunity cost of working is not, like the opportunity cost of working being time dedicated to studies is not."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_001_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I agree as to a person having to find a part-time job might be beneficial for her. Also, when a person is deciding whether to embark on a part-time job, he has a certain amount of free time to carry out the activity for a specific period of his studies before finding a real full-time job. Now, having a part-time job would be beneficial because it is a precursor to a full occupation that one would have when he begins his career in the working world. Now, he would gain many valuable experiences in many different domains. For example, he would be able to pursue his interests through his part-time job to come to a conclusion if this is something that he is interested in pursuing in the near future. Furthermore, he would have the experience of working with others, and that too would be a very valuable lesson for him because he would know what it means to, for example, exhibit certain qualities like teamwork and understanding as well as forgiveness and he would be able to be put in a situation with others having to have a part-time job."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_002_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " I think part-time work is actually quite crucial for college students because if we are asked to actually lighten the financial burden of parents and ourselves so that actually after we graduate we can actually prepare for our work and career instead of paying back for the bank loans. At the same time, it's also a way to showcase how us as students, university students can actually juggle with our schoolwork at the same time to reach out as well. I also believe that doing part-time work is also providing service to the community. It's not just part-time work at the same, at the point where like we just do our own things and not really contributing society and the community as well. It's actually a part of contributing to the whole economy of Singapore as well. Yeah, I was looking at actually doing part-time work during our university as a once in a lifetime experience because after a once in a lifetime experience we don't really have the opportunity to do part-time jobs."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_003_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I think it is important to have a part-time job because given the situation in Singapore, tuition fees are actually expensive and we need the money to pay for the expensive tuition fees and so working a part-time job can actually relieve some financial burden especially from people who do not come from very high income families. Working part-time job can also give you more experience because you are stepping into the workforce and then people, you are able to interact with people and you are able to learn the ropes of doing your job properly and so I think apart from monetary gains, you also get some sort of valuable experience and examples of part-time job include working as baristas in Starbucks or in Singapore."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_004_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " Personally, as someone that has a part-time job, I feel that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job. Not only it teaches you how to manage your time well because you need to juggle your studies as well as your job, it teaches you how to interact with others outside of the classroom. For example, it gives me opportunities to interact with adults which really have real-life experience working outside. Furthermore, it teaches you how to be financially independent. For example, you have to save your income. You cannot spend everything within a certain time period. You have to save for the future. It teaches you how to treasure money which may come easily from your parents. Also, I feel that having a part-time job allows you to have more opportunity to practice your social skills, which may be important for having a full-time job after I graduate. That's all I have to say."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_005_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " I think it's very important for students to get a part-time job because not only do you gain experience, you learn about soft and hard skills. Hard skills include like being, allows you to be more independent and it allows you to like cleaning up and in terms of like cooking. Soft skills include communicating with other people and learning how to better present yourself, makes dreams. I think that a part-time job gives you industrial exposure and allows you to better learn about the dream job that you want to have before you actually commit to it when you get a proper job in the future. And not only is this important, it allows you to learn the skills required and you better know what is required from your job. Next, financial independence. I think that getting a part-time job is very important. It allows you to support yourself. As college textbook fees are really expensive these few days. Getting this financial independence from getting a part-time job and also learning that you will allow you to better sustain yourself."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_006_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " So first, yes, I would agree that you have to do a part-time job because you earn money and also you learn how to, you learn different experiences and also because of, because you earn your own money, you learn how to budget more. So you learn how to not, you learn how to be more spend-trif and not to be, you have to be more thrifty, I mean, and learn not to, learn not to spend on. And also you learn how to manage your time well because if the job well, studies can work at the same time and I think this is an important skill, especially when you graduate and go into the working industry next thing. Also, it teaches us skills that we can't actually learn from the school, like relationship, management relationships, or like working in a team, or like, you know, how to handle customers, I think that's really important. And yeah, skills that you actually, that can be transferable from job to job doesn't mean that this is necessarily only one potential."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_007_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " So a part-time job will definitely teach you things such as how to better communicate with people, how to better interact with people about time management and this sort, and how to manage your resources. But there are a lot of different things that come into play when thinking about pursuing a part-time job for when. What does your major already require you to do? If you already have lab work, if you already have field work and internships that are compulsory to go for, then is it necessary to go for a part-time job? Do you have the time? Another thing you should think about is whether you need these additional financial resources provided by a part-time job. If your family isn't that well-to-do, then it makes sense to supplement your income with an additional part-time job. But if you're doing fine and if you're doing well, then getting a part-time job and getting the cash on the part-time job seems to be something that is redundant. That said, one could probably go and attend or apply for an internship. An internship is a bit more specialized."}

I think it is entirely dependent on a person's personal preference and whether they would like to and as well as their financial ability. If it's necessary for people to take up part-time jobs, I think some people may not be entirely willing or able to because university takes up a lot of time and effort. A lot of people may need the actual time taken to study. Being in a part-time job may deprive people of time taken to study. It also may deprive people socially. But although this being said, I think taking a part-time job may allow students to expand their horizons, give them more experiences and to be able to piece up their resume as well."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_PTJ2_010_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I think that it is true that students should get part-time jobs because it actually encourages them to become more independent individuals who are responsible for themselves. As you see since they are finally at the university, they are able to experience adulthood, so it is good in the sense that they are able to be more conscientious of what they spend on and they are able to be more responsible for their own purchases. On the other hand, we also need to acknowledge that a lot of students, their priority is to study, so when you take on part-time jobs, you might not have time to study and at the same time, we do know that student life is very important to character development. So in terms of joining co-curricular activities like netball, sports, clubs, society, these are very important to developing the student's character as well. So when you come to an end-up, you might not be able to go."}

For example, students enter university, it's time that they step up and take charge of their financial capabilities, especially since their parents have raised them for so many years. At the same time, it encourages them to take one step forward towards adulthood and be able to earn money for themselves and become more independent, responsible individuals and they will over go the process. But at the same time, we might also acknowledge that students have a lot of priorities and they have a lot of things to do, like multiple joining, CCAs, activities, making friends and all that. And so if they are not able to handle everything very well, then it might be difficult. And a student's priority should be that of studying. So if a student is not able to cope with the part-time job, then maybe it's better that they work on it. Working can be done in the later years and for now, the students should focus on it."}

The one where having a partner while you're studying will give you more experience in the future, like when you go out to work after your graduation, like you can learn more about teamwork and leadership skills. So that next time it will help you, it will give you a better advantage in the future when you're working on a project or something. And you can also learn time management. You will definitely be able to juggle over time, your time between your family, friends and studies, like you will eventually learn. And not only that, you will be meeting different kinds of people, like you'll be able to understand how different kinds of people work and how you can respond to each and every one of them so that next time you actually go out to work with your higher ups or your colleagues, you'll be able to understand how to respond to that different attitude and stuff.

Some might say that holding a part-time job will help to hold skills and for students to be more responsible for their finances, but I feel that it will come at the price of students being less able to concentrate during classes and have a negative impact on their studies. So I feel that instead of students having to choose to participate in co-curricular activities, recording CCs, because I feel that it gives students a co-opportunity to learn and develop skills with their friends and in planning and executing the different jobs and of their classes."}

So with travelling you are able to see experiences beyond your country because when you work, you are just dealing with people of, in a sense, the same nationality. So when you travel, you are able to experience what other people and other cultures really think, and that will really broaden your mindset. And also the next thing is that with part-time jobs, definitely you will sacrifice your family relationships and your family relationships. And these relationships may be more important than experience. Sometimes when you are feeling down or at a low point in your life, these are the people who will come in and help you to carry on with your life. So if you have been too work-minded for the past 10, 20 years, without the family relationship to support you when your work life disappears."}

However, if you're a communications student and you're working as a telemarketer or online surveyor, then perhaps whatever you learn will be more applicable. It also depends on how long you spend on the job. So if you're spending one to two days a week on the weekends, then it's okay. But if you're spending five days a week and it's affecting your studies, then it may not be as advisable for you to do that. And it also depends on what's the purpose of studying. If you're doing it just for an extra money, then it's okay.

Lastly, I believe that this part-time income can be used partly to pay off the college loans that one will incur after studying in college.

They will have to manage their spending to not waste money, to save money, and to be able to control their spending and spend it wisely. Secondly, they can also learn the soft skills that come with every job. I think that the working world is very different from school and socializing with friends is very different from socializing with co-workers and employers. So having these soft skills will definitely help in their job when they join the workforce in the future. It will also go towards a better working experience."}

So when you are in college, you actually have some fees and money to go through your college or your expenses. And at the same time, it's very important to have part-time jobs for the experience because in working life, interviewers actually look out for experience while you go for interviews. So when they know that you do have some experience in doing part-time jobs such as giving tuition, being a promoter, it actually like trains up your skills and you actually have a set of skills after learning and going through the part-time jobs. So in the workplace, I think they might be looking out for such experiences and at the same time, you yourself will have a general direction and idea on how working life is and you wouldn't be very like blur about the entire thing."}

Because having a part-time job actually results in a student devoting less time for study, and hence he will adversely affect his grades. Besides that, having a part-time job means the student has to be responsible for the job. And actually to do the job well, he has to actually be devoted to the job as well. This actually generates more stress for him in the course of study, and also at the same time adversely affects his grades. However, having a job could also relieve his financial burdens. As we know, the tuition fees of these students are very expensive. Having a part-time job could actually help keep all of us from actually elevating the financial stress."}

But those who disagree will say that this is time to have fun and enjoy and they should not be working before going out into the working world. I particularly subscribe to the disagreeing statement because I feel that there are other ways to inculcate discipline and responsibility, which is through household chores and even living on your own. Particularly I feel that in this time before students go out to work, they should be given time to explore their interests and to discover what their true passion is and their calling is about before actually launching themselves into the working world. Of course, if those who have an idea of what they want to do, I think working part-time specific areas which they are sure to go into would be helpful for their development."}

So they get to learn how to interact with people and they get to see how do people act when in different sort of occasions.

And also having a part-time job actually allows us to learn how to have better time management because you have to juggle both your studies and jobs. So actually, I think this will be good for real life in the future when we have more demand from outside world and maybe family commitments as we age. Besides that, I think part-time jobs also allows us to manage our finances more carefully and we can also better juggle our monetary issues instead of facing all these issues when we step into the outside world working in industry right after we graduate."}

However, this requires a very delicate balance between work and study, so as not to disrupt either. For example, if they attribute too much time for their work, they may neglect their studies. And similarly, if they emphasize too much on studies, they may not do well at their part-time job and may end up getting fired, which will arguably be more detrimental to their resume than not having work experience."}

And lastly, taking up a part-time job during college actually helps them to prepare for life in the workforce compared to what they experience during college, during their schooling days and as a member of the workforce, the experience is very much different. So taking up a part-time job actually allows them to bridge that gap between schooling and education, therefore facilitating their transition into the workforce and making the experience more manageable and less traumatic, I would say."}

So I think in that way, a part-time job is important. But at the same time, it depends on whether the student can manage their time.

Just before that, basically, that one was I disagree that they should find a part-time job because that would get into their studying time as well as time for other activities in school, such as learning different sports and stuff which are important for their teenage growth or their youth because it's the last time that they're going to have all these opportunities within school and cultivate that last school spirit that they have before they adventure in the working world."}

And this will also help them anchor the thoughts when they are communicating, say, to the professors or to the classroom presentations. Besides such communication skills, those will also come in greatly useful when they go out to work after graduation.

Overall, for the general college student population, I do not think that it is important for students to study as the priority of students is the academic.

But while these are the good points of having a part-time job, they are also the negative side of having a part-time job if students are not able to manage their time well because they have to balance between school and work.

The only way to pay off those student loans is still depending on your parents is to pay with your own money and this money will be earned through your part-time jobs. Thirdly, there is no point in just learning stuff off the books in universities. You need experience from internships. It is very important because you have to know how to apply what you learn in college into what you actually do in real life.

For example, in school there's a lot of opportunities given to develop his skills, for example like joining co-curricular activities and say leadership positions, etc. And I think it will give him more exposure to society and much in how people usually go about their daily activities.

However, the lack of long-term commitment makes this lack of responsibility towards a job, and it also makes training difficult. However, I still think that students should go out there and put themselves into part-time jobs because it is so beneficial in so many ways, because they also help to lighten the family's burden on financials, and they learn the true value of money because they know it is not easy to spend, but it is so difficult to earn money these days."}

The reason is because there are many scientific studies that have gone to show and it is empirically proven that smoking isn't really good for one's health and it is in fact a form of addiction just like how you would be taking drugs. Now definitely this form of a ban would definitely be very painful, especially for smokers. But nonetheless, I believe that it will be necessary in order to change the society for the better.

Secondly, there are negative health effects from smoking in terms of affecting the individual who smokes and so as the people surrounding the individual due to the secondhand smoking.

So already a lot has been done to curb smoking. Other things, but when you think about it, this pushes people to smoke more in your private locations such as in your homes. And so this increases the chance of your family members or your children being exposed to secondhand smoke. And secondhand smoke, as we all know, is very harmful. There are no benefits from secondhand smoke. So in that sense, I think yes, smoking should be banned completely to help."}

But if the government bans smoking in all places, then this will make it even more difficult for people to find places where they can smoke. And then this will just result in even more smokers smoking in places that are not designated for them to smoke in, which is not great because it will contribute more harm to other people in the public."}

If people are smoking in the area, they can leave the area if they do not like it. Model 2nd hand smoke is harmful to people. There should be some areas allocated to the smokers because it is the state of getting an outright ban on all areas. This is why the smoking ban should not be entirely a blanket ban. It should be in select areas only, not in all. Smokers also have rights to smoke where they want to smoke, but this cannot be at cost to smokers. So there must be careful observance of both people's rights."}

In that sense, smoking is not just an individual personal activity, it also extends to having negative experiences that impose upon the people around them. In that sense, it is quite inconsiderate such that a personal activity becomes not a very personal thing. A personal gain becomes an extended burden for other people. So, yes, I do agree with the statement and I do think that it should be banned. But on the other hand, I also know that a lot of restaurants have smoking corners and people can just go outside to smoke instead of staying within the enclosed area. And of course, smoking is still a very important activity for them."}

And in that sense, it is very inconsiderate and at the same time, it is very unpleasurable for the people around him or her. And at the same time, it brings a lot of health, negative health activities as well. So many restaurants in Singapore, for example McDonald's, they actually have outdoor smoking corners for certain smokers. So this is perhaps one of the solutions to what the problem has posed."}

Okay, I disagree mainly because firstly, the economy will be affected greatly, okay, because right now there are many, many companies who actually sell cigarettes and all. So if they actually ban it and these companies stop selling cigarettes, many people will actually lose their jobs. Also, those who are addicted to cigarettes might turn to other drugs that they can get hold on. And a lot of people actually smoke. Okay, not in Singapore, for example, in Korea, because it's cold.

So further is that the second-hand smoke actually destroys the dining experience for those around them. So while you are enjoying, the smoker is enjoying, you actually ruin the experience for other people around you. So that seems to be a very selfish move.

It is considered to the non-smokers and the ban would bring the smoking elsewhere and allow everyone to have a good time and focus on the meal and the services provided by the restaurant that have been specially prepared for them.

So I don't think that banning smoking completely from restaurants is actually a good thing. If it has to be done, maybe it could be done in a way that is currently being done where different parts of the restaurant are segmented to non-smoking and smoking areas.

However, I feel that it should not be banned. I feel it should be moved to a location where it's less enclosed as restaurants are enclosed areas, possibly with women and children, women who are pregnant. So essentially, it should move these smoking areas to outside the restaurant or perhaps have a designated smoking area for those who smoke to accommodate and cater for every type of customer there because not everyone would wait patiently doing nothing while waiting for their food in restaurants. Also, I choose to believe that by banning smoking, it would result in a massive loss in the business and that could affect their profits and such."}

So what happens is that, to me, as a person, I think that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants and dining areas, because it actually affects the dining experience of other people, and not just the smoker himself, but other people. Yes, and even though having designated smoking areas might help, however, but smoke still travels.

Instead, I would opt for a more stringent regulation on smoking, especially in public areas that are frequently, they are frequented by mothers, they are frequented by children and families, and secondhand smoke is very detrimental to their health. And the government should also put a complete ban on certain retailers in certain areas from selling cigarettes so as to prevent the inconvenience of people actually buying and then smoking in those areas.

This is because, after all empirical scientific studies have already proven that smoking is not good for one's health and furthermore it can even cause certain psychological disorders like depression and essentially it is an addiction which would definitely be very difficult to come into control. Furthermore there is this issue of second hand smoke which would affect those who are constantly exposed to the smokers. For example if you think about members who have to deal with second hand smoke, of course if you are a member in a household then you would know that it is not harmful to a person to the smoking itself but rather harmful to those around him.

So the social construct of smoking is actually very bad and the next thing is that they actually don't condone smoking in public places. So banning smoking in Singapore is perfectly fine unless we are talking about tourism because sometimes they are not too sure about whether we can smoke in restaurants.

There are also many negative externalities attached to smoking. When one person smokes, it will affect the quality of air of the people who are around him. However, it is actually impossible to completely ban smoking because governments earn a lot of tax revenue from selling cigarettes.

Firstly, talking about the benefits, there are economic benefits to smoking because it allows the government to impose high taxes to raise funds for their governmental projects. For example, in Singapore, high taxes are levied on these vices to raise funds for governmental projects to better develop the country's infrastructure. These cigarettes are actually priced about two to three times higher than their original prices that they are imported in. So in a way, these cigarettes are actually benefiting other projects that the government wishes to fund and better develop the country. Secondly, a negative health effect from smoking such as secondhand smoking, which not only affects individuals but also those around, increases the probability of getting high of getting lung cancer and the financial strain on families, which ties into many other social effects."}

But even still, restaurants will not want to totally ban smoking because that will deter customers away from their restaurants. Therefore, it's not possible to do so.

And so I think most restaurants already choose not to allow the patrons to smoke in them. So, you know, going one step further to completely ban it from all restaurants, I think makes sense and there isn't going to be much harm done. But that's it, you know, smokers, they have their freedom of choice. And if they do want to smoke and if they do want to have a good meal, then there should be some restaurants that do cater for this. Otherwise, they're going to be eating takeaway all the time. And taxes, for example, that smokers pay to buy their cigarettes or perhaps they pay to these restaurants that allow them to smoke will definitely help with business or help with the government and give them more resources that we can then pump into doing more beneficial things.

As a result, I think there should be an allocated area, a special area for smokers that is located away from the main dining area so that non-smokers and smokers are separated and segregated so that people can enjoy their rights.

And within the restaurant, especially since it's such an enclosed space, then it's very, very bad for them.

So for example, babies and pregnant women, they will actually receive health damage to some extent.

In Singapore, there's the policy of a smoking corner marked out by a yellow box that allows smokers to continue smoking while not affecting the other people around them. But the thing is, smoke does not simply stay in an area, it goes with the wind. So if restaurants ban smoking, then everybody will not be affected by smoke. So there will be no secondhand smoke that's inhaled by people that are dining near smokers.

Cigarettes tend to be very expensive and smokers who are heavy smokers will spend a lot of money in order to buy these cigarettes and keep up with this bad habit of theirs. As such, they would spend a large proportion of their income, and some of whom may not even be able to afford that amount and that cost incurred by cigarettes. Also, smoking, while smoking can be detrimental, there is a positive effect in terms of economic benefits for the country. And this can be seen in how they are heavy smokers."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_038_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " Yes, I do agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants. The first reason is that secondhand smoke is detrimental to food ever nearby that we fit in. The second reason is that even if a restaurant has a designated smoking area outside of the building, the people sitting in that area might not necessarily all be smokers. So in the case of a family who has young children, if they sit near a smoker, then these children actually suffer the effects of secondhand smoke. Thirdly, a restaurant is a place for people to come together and to eat their food in enjoyment. So the smell of smoke is already quite a turn off. So it is actually not... It is better."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_039_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " Firstly, I agree that smoking in restaurants should be completely banned in the entire country. Firstly, smoking is very bad for the smokers' health. And worse, secondhand smoke that is emitted from any smoker has a worse impact on innocent bystanders, people who do not actually commit any wrong or are not even involved in the smoking act itself. Restaurants are a very special place. Smoking is meant for people who wish to meet up with friends, who wish to eat, who wish to celebrate a special occasion. And these smokers who just bring in cigarette smoke into restaurants and into people's faces while trying to eat are just spoiling the mood. Smoking in restaurants should be banned because there are better places for these smokers to smoke at. There are other places that are designated specially for them. And instead of ruining the mood, they should respect people who choose to dine in restaurants and bring their smoke."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_040_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " If you are referring to banning smoking in restaurants, then I have to say I agree with that. Because in the restaurant environment, since most restaurants these days are air conditioned, they are indoors and diners will have to have a good and clean environment free of any form of pollution from smoking, etc. They will need to have these kind of bans from smoking put in place to ensure that diners will have people enjoy their meals, will have fun. And especially when families dining together, they do not want their food to be accompanied with smoke. So I would say that I agree with the move to ban smoking from restaurants. But if you are talking about a larger context in banning smoking across the country, then that is an entirely different situation to tackle."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_041_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " I think smoking should be banned because of all the better mental health effects it gives, especially second-hand smoke. I mean, it's not only detrimental to the smoke itself, but second-hand smoke is actually more dangerous. I think if smoking is banned, it would be for the betterment of society as a whole, because I'm sure the workforce would be more productive as people shop, falling sick and incurring extra healthcare costs with company and for themselves as a whole. I think overall people would be healthier, enjoying a better, happier life. But then again, I wonder if there will be other problems, because people may try to sneak in and smuggle all these cigarettes so they will be able to settle their smoking addiction. I think banning is quite an extreme thing. Maybe perhaps it could give some time to smokers to sleep just in life without cigarettes at all."}

There is cancer, there is heart disease, there are so many things to worry about. And having one less social ill such as smoking to worry about wouldn't hurt. In fact, we would be better off if we wanted to face the problems of smoking. Now the younger generation are more susceptible to influences of smoking. And the restaurant is actually a family place.

However, I do believe that at the end of the day, each and every one of us should have the right to choose for themselves, for himself or herself, what he or she would want to consume. However, if that choice is negatively affecting others around them, then perhaps other alternatives or other arrangements can be made for these people who choose to smoke, such as, for example, giving them a designated location to smoke, or perhaps limiting their times at which they can smoke, or just other means through which you can have a compromise, as the best of both worlds, where you allow the choice of smoking to be had, and at the same time to protect those..."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_045_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " One must also recognize that restaurants are places where both children and adults go to, and it's also a place where people are trying to enjoy their meal and have a good conversation in that place. So because people spend a lot of time in restaurants and these tend to be indoors, but the air circulation is not the best and where many times children are also present, it's a good idea for smoking to be banned in the insides of restaurants, but maybe to be fair to smokers to give them the leeway to be outside the restaurant and smoke there, where the air circulation is much better and children will not breathe in any secondhand smoke or cancerous fumes. Other reasons why smoking should probably be banned in restaurants is that it may interact with the food as well, and we are not sure."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_046_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " As I was saying for question 8, I believe that if smokers want to smoke, they are able to head out to an isolated area, for example, a place where smokers usually go to smoke and they don't have to smoke in a restaurant. So I don't see the banning as a severe curtailing of their rights. Human rights to do whatever they want. They have the right to smoke. If they choose to smoke, they should respect the decision of non-smokers to not smoke or to not take in second-hand smoke, especially. So I believe that would be a fair way of going about doing it. And therefore, I believe that there should be a complete ban on smoking in restaurants so that non-smokers are not exposed to smoke unnecessarily."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_047_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " I think that yes, smoking in restaurants should be banned completely. This is because we are at a restaurant to eat. And this includes all the other people, especially the non-smokers. So as smokers, if they really have to smoke during their meal times, they should go out of the restaurant, excuse themselves, go out of the restaurant and just smoke. Because the other people are at the restaurant to eat, not to breathe in their second hand smoke or whatever. Because this will really harm the people and it also can cause discomfort and irritation. Furthermore, yeah, for smoking in general, however, I think that it should not be banned because as citizens of a country, they have the free choice to choose what they want to do. That includes smoking. So it should be restricted but not banned. Perhaps restricted to places that are far away enough from public places, entrances, and smoking corners where they will not cause discomfort to others."}

But you also have to understand that by banning smoking in restaurants and such would have adverse effects on businesses. Restaurants are in closed areas and they may have women and children, which may be a very, very difficult thing. Smoking in restaurants would be tough, but what can be done is to move these smoking areas to outside the restaurant. Perhaps have designated smoking areas opposite, that customers can only smoke outside restaurants, which would make it easier for them. So you can cater to everybody who, every single type of customer, smokers and non-smokers like, which would have a better effect for business as well as it will not compromise the health of fellow patrons of the restaurant."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_049_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " We should also take into account where families visit restaurants and dine outside with their little children who are very sensitive to smoking. So to actually ban smoking in dining areas in restaurants actually would help to increase the air quality around the restaurant and actually benefit more customers because the smoke from smoking is harmful. Especially to little children, you do not want them to pick up the habit. So we actually try not to expose little children to the harmful smoke that is being exhaled by these cigarettes. So that's about it. So I feel that smoking should be banned in all eating areas in restaurants."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_050_B1_2.mp3", "label": "B1_2", "text": " Okay, sorry, in response to my first task, I do believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants, definitely, because restaurants are places that are frequented by the general public and we cannot cater just for smokers. Because there are non-smokers there and non-smokers clearly have, the reason why they choose not to smoke is because they treasure their health and they prioritize it over the benefits of smoking. And so clearly to cater to the wider audience and to families and to the general public, smoking should be banned in all restaurants because it clearly goes against and is detrimental to public health because it causes lung cancer and other forms of cancers which are scientifically proven. And so smoking should instead be banned."}

Part-time jobs make you a lot more experienced, make you prepare for your real job in the future, make you prepare for the people you will have to know, the situation you may have to handle. Part-time jobs is an option. Some of the college people have part-time jobs, some of them don't have it. I have part-time jobs once as a tutoring for English for the primary school.

So I think focusing on what we study is better more than getting some time on the part-time job. If you have bad grades, you won't get the career that you dreamed of as what you dreamed of living after being in college. So spending time on study is really better.

I was around five years within my career as a journalist. I came across this interesting and ludicrous post about the former US President Donald Trump's misuse of the word Persian Gulf. He referred to the Persian Gulf as Arabian Gulf, and it ignited a wave of mockery across the social media. I saw people because I'm a journalist. Back then, I was assigned with this task to cover Iranians' reaction to Trump's use of or misuse of the word Persian Gulf. Then, it was really hilarious how people tried to play down his usage of this body of water. I came across some people. I interviewed a lot of people who said that Donald Trump does not know geography. Perhaps he has to go back to school and try to learn geography again."}

And as of now, the coronavirus is on the main issue, but usually during this time of the year, the weather forecast always talks about how bad the microdust is.

So therefore I think that children are not still able to make decisions on their own.

Because we think too much. We think about the possible outcomes and something that is not possible. So yes, that's why we limit ourselves. And some people do not want to go over their comfort zones, because sometimes making decisions means that you have to go over your expectations and everything.

So that's the reason why I think I'm going to continue doing this challenge for myself and I think yeah rather than watching movies that I used to do and it made me stressed out because I usually like look at the people and I feel like I'm just like loser or something but reading the books I'm finding out that there are like people who are having the same problems with me but still like trying to move on.

So the decision I made was about the challenge that actually I challenged myself to read books, like three books in a month. And when I started it, I think I have to say that it was the end of my semester and that was November. The reason why I decided to read three books in a month was because I was a psychiatrist and I was in the early stages of the panic disorder. And, you know, if I do not recover from it, that will have a disastrous like the consequence in the future. Therefore, the psychiatrist decided me to do something that I really like. So I love studying and I love reading. Therefore, I decided to read books and challenge myself. And the result of it was quite astonishing. So far I have finished like six books because I started in November and it's already like two months and a half. So, you know, also I was able to get a lot of information and the things that I actually didn't know."}

{"filename": "ult53_video_C1.mp3", "label": "C1", "text": " Well, I'll go for the second option, because helping. Because sometimes parents just want their own desires. Like, OK, I want my son or my daughter to be a doctor. And let's say the child is interested in some kind of arts. And usually, this is the case. Parents reject their children who are interested or talented in art, just because they think that it's not a good way of earning money in the future. Therefore, it's going to stress out the kids. And I saw, like, I read books, and I saw my friends who were pressured by their parents having, like, losing both their talents and interest in life. So I think the role of the parents is just to help and guide. It's not like they should not force their kids to follow their decisions."}

But nowadays, maybe the last 10 years, it's more common for people to eat outside and use restaurants to not to get starving. So nowadays it's common to eat outside for people.

Many people like to do things individually, especially with the technology accessible, like we have our laptops, we have tablets, and just walking around with our phones and being connected to the internet.

{"filename": "ult7_video_C2 (5).mp3", "label": "C2", "text": " Well, I consider my country, if I'm going to answer this question, I consider the nation that I come from to be a country very much involved with the media. I'll call it the mother of all media, the UK, because they created the BBC, they created the BBC Radio many years ago. I think it was sometime in the mid-20th century. So I think it's very, very important. They have governmental channels. They also have lots of private channels and plenty of people like to watch these channels. You can watch anything you want. You can view movies, TV series, soap operas, but nowadays, obviously because of the internet and technology, people prefer to watch the same shows that our televisions are showing on their phones, maybe laptops, maybe Netflix, so that's a social media channel and everything. So there might be a pay-per-view and they might want to watch a certain TV channel."}

I want to talk about Bruce Nolan's Generation Game. So it is a quiz game, and basically it applies to families on the stage when they have a live audience. So these two groups, these two families, basically they would have to get into games and do different activities and then they'll be scored at the very end. And I always found that very interesting because they get put in situations where they wouldn't know how to, for example, make pottery or how to act on the stage, it depends what the activity is. We always watch this program. We found out about it from ITV, they were advertising. ITV is our channel three in the UK. And we just love to sit around the television and watch that together as a family. We find it most fun. So I enjoy the activities that they do. Like I said, they get onto the stage, they have to do an acting game or they'll be maybe making a painting to see who could perform the painting better than the other. And I always like the way the presenter hosts the show. He's always very energetic and the way he addresses the candidates and then the way he talks to the audience. It's always very theatrical."}

And I remember what's funny, because one guy showed me their camera with their family in Argentina. And I see all the people screaming and saying bad words when some player do a mistake or something."}

And rather than that, we can give them something positive to focus on and say, while this that you did was good, I think you should do this or kind of guide them in a certain way instead of scolding or even hitting or abusing your child, which is really important on the child's development as well.

I mean, even till today, we have students who apply through secure my scholarship for on campus classes and online classes. And 99 percent of students are applying for on campus classes. Online just didn't shake up the industry like everybody predicted. But I think the real change is in the mode of education itself. Gone are the days where you have to go to class, take notes, memorize, come back next week and regurgitate that on a test or an exam. That doesn't work anymore. You're not training people the right way because today if you need information, there's Google, there's chat GPT and probably a lot other resources that can't come to mind right now. But information is available at your fingertips. What you need to train people about or train people for today is how to utilize this information. How well can you analyze the information in front of you? How well can you use the data that you have available to you? Do you know where to look? How well can you think through the problem to then break it down and then find the solution in the sea of information available on the Internet? How well can you do these things? How creatively can you think through a problem and figure out a solution? These are things that cannot be replaced very easily by chat GPT or Google or whatever. These are the skills of the future. Memorization and answering questions on an exam is it's not really required anymore. And I think this this shift is already happening and will really become more profound maybe 10 or 15 years from now."}

Now, who determines how scholarships are given out? And I know there's a lot of foul play at the university level or, you know, this guy is my cousin's kid, so give him 100% scholarship. It shouldn't be like that. There should be an unbiased council that has to vote and decide or however these things are done, which should be fair.

So that's something that I am passionate about That's also why I work a hundred hours a week on secure my scholarship So, I mean if there's a charity or a nonprofit that's committed to this cause then 100% and the third I guess Stakeholder is the universities themselves. I mean, let's let's get one thing straight right universities are incredibly wealthy institutions You look at not even your top 20 or top 30 you look at your top 200 Universities in the US in the UK they have billion dollar endowment funds that are invested into you know, some some invested into government bonds or T builds or or whatever it may be There are Billy. I think Harvard's endowment fund is 40 billion or 50 billion I mean don't quote me on that but it's it's in that ballpark range That's a lot of money from a university standpoint as well I feel like it should just be a part of their social responsibility to give back to the community that has given them so much That's what I think"}

And I love doing this job now because when I was growing up, I loved writing little stories and just connecting with people and having conversations. I never thought that I could become a speaker one day. I started my career in STEM and then ventured through 16 different industries because I didn't really know where in the world of work I fit into. But eventually I realized that all this became really useful for me to gain all the skills that I needed in communication and brought it all together in a field that I was deeply passionate about. That allowed me to channel what I really love about my work and a topic that I love, to make a difference in people's lives. Being a speaker is the perfect place to do this because you could influence people's thoughts and inspire positivity in people's lives, which is something that you could do in other places, but the impact is so much more immediate. And you are affecting people in such a big way and affecting a bigger audience as well whilst you're doing it. This is something that I'm very lucky to be able to do now. And I don't take it for granted and know that the journey for me to get here has been really long but I'm deeply grateful for being given this opportunity. And why I like it also is that to be able to connect with people in a topic that is so personal about mental health and well-being, where in some way or other we're all struggling in life.

I think, I mean, from what I've heard, I've never worked as a chef or worked in a kitchen before, but I think it takes a lot of trial and error. So for that reason, I would imagine that the person would have to be very patient. And with that patience, you need to have an inherent passion for the food that you're making. I think chefs usually specialize in one or more cuisines. So just having an understanding of the background of the spices, where it comes from, of the meat, where it comes from. If you're not passionate about that, it can probably tire you out to be that invested in learning.

So we really just connected and got to know each other really well during that shoot. And the unusual thing that she does is that she always wears two coats on top of each other. So, for example, some people would wear like a, you know, one of those inner coats first, and then they would put an outer coat on on top of it. But she just wears two like full blown winter coats on top of each other, which is quite strange, like I've never seen them before. So, yeah, but she always says she feels cold. So that's her method of dealing with the winter in Korea. Yeah. So that's quite unusual. But she her style in general is unusual. Like she always dyes part part of her hair red. So it's not all of her hair, but just like part of it. And then she would combine like like workout clothes, like gym wear with heels or the other way around, like a skirt and then like big sneakers.

So I learned a lot while watching this documentary because my husband used to make fun of me. Okay, why you are using buckwheat flour instead of the normal flour? When I watch this documentary, I've got the answer. And I told him, look, when you eat this flour instead of this, it will help your blood not to, how to say it, to absorb the sugar.

And then I saw a lot of people who were posting the same stories, but from different places. A friend of mine came over. We had a glass of wine on the balcony and then it started to rain, like heavily, rain heavily. So thunderstorm, rain. And it's just not very common to see that in Dubai. That's why I thought the weather was perfect, because it's always hot and sunny and humid. And as soon as the season starts to change, I think they do something called cloud seating, where then they make it rain, apparently. So it was very beautiful to see the rain.

I mean, in the sense, it's a friend, right? It's not a profession. Sometimes I've had my friends complaining that Aparna, it's alright. I mean, you can chill because we're just meeting for a coffee. So it's okay if they get a little bit late. If it's only like 10-15 minutes, it's fine."}

It was there in our textbooks. But I think I grew more fond and more interested in history way later when I started reading about civilizations, when I started reading about different areas and regions and how the world was divided and then invaded by different kingships, if I can call that. So yes, it was only later that I started getting interested in history. So it says, describe a time when you were late for something. So I'm usually a very punctual person and I can't think of any time when I was really late, but there have been a few instances. And one such instance was when I got really, really late was for my work. So I'm new to London and I've started teaching yoga over here. It's been about six to eight months and I'm still understanding the tube work, like how does the commute work over here? How does the bus work over here? And also the timings and everything. So I'm still adjusting myself to the city. So there was this one class I was supposed to reach after two classes, which I was already taking in Angel. So there was this one area called Angel. I was taking two classes over there. Right after that, there was another class in another area and I was supposed to reach there. This another class wasn't mine. So I was covering for someone and I got like a last moment notification that can you take this class? And I accepted it, really vouching for it and really saying that I will be there. It was very disheartening for me because by the time I wrapped up the studio and I left from there, I couldn't make it on time. And this is a big professional setback on my end because I shouldn't be doing that. And what happened was that I went for, I thought I'll take a bus. So I took a bus and by the time I was about to reach a certain location, I realized I've taken the wrong bus. So I got down and then I tried to take a train. So by the time I tried to reach the next best train location, I realized that the train station was shut. That is when I started panicking. I started looking for a cab and I started contacting my DM, which is like a manager who's always on call and checking if you're on time or not. And the DM told me this is really sad because it looks like I'll not be able to reach on time and even five minutes late is late for students. So they started asking questions like why is it that the train station is stopped like in the sense it's shut because probably I think they weren't believing me in that moment. But later when I described everything, I clicked pictures and finally they believed me. And when I reached. That's the two minutes."}

So yes, and sometimes I also like to watch just the history bit as well. Like I think I've seen that entire show on Netflix called the Roman Empire or something like that.

I think whenever people see tigers, they feel scared, or they might think they are dangerous because they have sharp teeth and they look kind of scary. And I think tigers are going to fewer in the future because this is considered as endangered because tigers are very unique these days. So some bad people try to catch it and try to make it as their own pet. So that people think that this tiger is very special to them. So I think tigers would be fewer in the future. Ah, okay."}

How I felt about the experience was that I was at first very nervous that I might not have a good dress for prom basically.

And I think there is that extra bit of kind of care you can get from like in-person meetings. Sorry. When you go to a tailor to get you a suit, I think that kind of thing can only happen in person.

But it might be harder because you don't have that personal kind of experience with the seller. So I think the response would be also similar to what you would do in an offline shopping mall. You can post complaints to their superiors or a representative board of that shopping company. Or you can share your opinions with other customers. I think that's much easier for online shopping malls because they require a review section so that people can have more trust in their products. So yes, I think those would be the responses."}

So when it was your birthday, it was the one day of the year that you were allowed to wear whatever you wanted. So it was a big deal. I mean, at least I would pick out my outfit like two months in advance. It would be like a little dress, like a princessy frock, matching shoes, matching accessories for your hair. And then you would take some kind of chocolate or candy to school. And then you could take like a period off and go and give the candy out to other teachers and other kids in the school. And we looked forward to it every year. It was the highlight to get to not have to wear the uniform, to wear whatever you wanted, and to basically be able to skip class and go out and hand out chocolates because it's your birthday."}

{"filename": "video52_c2.mp3", "label": "C2", "text": " Yes, I think it becomes harder for people to make friends as they get older. I think adults are perhaps a little bit more structured. I mean, the older that you get, the more set you get in your ways, your routine, where you work, your family, your gym. For children, it's very easy for children to interact with other children. Like if you put two kids in a room and three seconds they're talking to each other without any restrictions, they're talking about all of their family secrets and everything, they're comfortable. But with adults, obviously, people tend to be more filtered when they interact with other adults. Also, I think if you've been friends from the time that you were a child with somebody, you've lived through so many life events together that that kind of bond is hard to build with someone that you meet in your mid-30s because you've just lost so much time that you're learning something, you're learning about them from scratch, where they went to school, about their family, about their relationships, about their siblings. So, yeah, I think it's not impossible. You can make a lot of incredible friendships later in life, but it's probably harder to come by than if you were a kid in play school."}
{"filename": "video53_c2.mp3", "label": "C2", "text": " of making new friends online. I think there's more disadvantages to making new friends. I mean there was a show recently that came out on Netflix called Tender Swindler. The thing is with most of what we see online isn't real, whether it's social media or even news for that matter. Everything is kind of edited and monitored to present a certain kind of image. So if you meet somebody online and you know nothing about them, they can really present any version of reality or a completely curated, sometimes dishonest form of their reality to you. So it's a very dangerous game to play."}
{"filename": "video54_c2.mp3", "label": "C2", "text": " Hmm. Again, that's a tricky one. Now, when I answer these questions, I'm thinking back to real life situations. And in some cases, I have seen parents interfering and trying to make those decisions for their children where they were right to do so because the child was in bad company and they were too naive or too... I mean, I guess they were just too naive to see that that situation was not right for them, but their parent obviously was able to identify that my child's in bad company. So in those cases, I would say that your parents are able to read a dangerous situation better. But there's also the flip side where. Everybody kind of does make bad decisions. Your parents made bad decisions, you made bad decisions, and the way that you learn from them is to have a negative experience and then find your way out of it. So I would say that I can see certain situations, whether it's bad relationships, bad friendships when you're younger, not relationships when you're younger, friendships when you're younger. Sometimes it's necessary to have that experience so that you know firsthand how to deal with that situation. And you may not be able to get that experience if your parents always shield you from every single thing that can go wrong. So I can kind of see depends on the situation, I would say."}

What I liked about her when I first saw her, I mean, we were sitting together where the teacher made us sit next to each other. She had this long hair, and it was like sectioned into two parts, and it was just braided all the way down. And she had the cutest face I've ever seen. She had this little fluffy marshmallow-like face. I guess that's all it takes when you're a kid to wanna be friends with somebody. And then I tried to, so there's like this little thing that kids do where they put their thumb out to show other kids that I wanna be your friend. And then if you don't wanna be friends with them, you do this, it's like a silly little thing. So I did this to her. I put my thumb out to say, hey, do you wanna be friends? And she was like this, and I was heartbroken. I was like, how can she not want to be my friend? And then I saw her again the next day, and the next day after that, and the day after that.

I went back to Taiwan last month and I stayed for about three weeks. I was visiting friends and family, but I don't really have much family in Taiwan, just my mum. I've noticed that in life, when you don't have a lot of family, the universe brings you friends. It might sound a bit clich, but friends really are the family that you've chosen. I've now moved away from Taiwan, but when I was there, I made a lot of very, very good lifelong friends. I go back and visit periodically. I visited Shirley, I've been friends with her since I was 15. That's about 15 years now, so you can guess my age. Tiffany, I've known her since I was 18. Cyril, Eva, I visited these friends in particular. We just pretty much, not to sound boring, we just hung out and talked a lot, caught up a lot on life, what's been happening, who are you dating, are you happy. There was a lot of that over wine or tea. I also went and visited Cyril's new restaurant. He's been doing really, really well for himself and very happy about that. We went and visited Jackie and found out that he was actually also back in Taiwan for his wedding. So we went to his wedding, had a bit too much whiskey, but that's okay.

So I lived in one house for 10 years and during that time there was a neighbor and it was basically a family, but I would describe most of the parent. So this parent was very extravagant. I would see this parent or this neighbor always coming in and out of their house in the best dressed suit. But one day actually their house burned down and it was like a huge thing like all across the news in our neighborhood. And basically, fortunately, nobody was hurt. But since the house burned down, they had to rebuild their house. And they took this opportunity to build this grand mansion in this tiny suburban neighborhood. There was this huge mansion with a huge fountain in front of their yard. And I was like, wow, it's quite an interesting person and quite showy and kind of extravagant. And yeah, that's what I say. And then should I just answer all the other questions? Yeah. So basically, I knew him through his children. And so his daughter and his son was around the same age as me. And we didn't do anything together much, but I would just always see him like through the front window of my house, just walking past. And then sometimes I would go over their house and play with them. And once they built their mansion, I actually got to go in and see and get a tour of their house. And it was quite it was quite like a palace, I would say. They had movie theater on the third floor. And they would love to be very hospitable to their visitors. And they would show basically everything about their interior. They're kind of, you know, in a way like they would like to show off like their riches, I would say. All right."}

It shouldn't have to be that way. Through Secure My Scholarship, I remember there was this one girl two weeks ago who applied for an MBA in the USA and the cost of that MBA was like $65,000, which I mean, $65,000 is a lot of money. And especially when you're earning in rupees in India, that's a hell of a lot of money. Now, I mean, what's her solution? I mean, should she give up on her dreams? Should she not go ahead and do it? I mean, what does she do? She applied through our platform. We helped her get a $25,000 scholarship to bring her fees down from $65,000 to $40,000. We can't make it free. Unfortunately, we're not the government. We're not God or the government or whatever. We can't make it free, but we can minimize it as much as we can.

Not just because, like for example, a lot of students go to school or academia and in that process they meet a lot of friends and they hang out and spend a lot of time with them.

I think it's important for them to learn and evaluate the current situation and see the course of history I guess and how things are changing and kind of adopting to that and not restricting their student, I mean restricting their children in any way of saying you have to stay in this tiny little box but also allow them to try different things as well and so that's a new skill I guess for them to learn."}

Whenever I got close I would have to change my country and so I would always, through that process I learned to be grateful, to be positive in the current situation and I learned it by I guess trying to just evaluate the situation in a more positive mindset and look at things that I can gain from it instead of the things that I've lost. And it's really important because it gave me a more positive outlook on life and also it allowed me to stay motivated to study or hang out with my friends or meet new people instead of dwelling on the things I've lost or the past.

The language or the words that they used were very different. Right now, I'm reading one of her books, Pride and Prejudice, and sometimes I have to Google what she's saying. I don't understand what she wrote. It's very interesting the way she writes or the language that she uses, describing the setting, the story setting. I really enjoy it.

This is a little recipe that I learned how to make, which is basically paneer. We call it cottage cheese in English. It's like a spice tomato base with cottage cheese, with paratha, roti, but it's made out of ragi flour, which is gluten free and super rich in calcium and very good for people with diabetes, although I don't have diabetes. It's very nutritious basically. Together it's the perfect meal. It keeps you full. I love being healthy. I try to be as healthy as I can. So yeah, that's probably my go-to meal in the evening, because I don't have to think about... I have all the ingredients. I don't have to think about how to make it. It's kind of automatic and it's delicious, which is the most important part. It's not compromising on the taste because I can't eat salmon and rice every day. I want to eat something that's more flavorful and nutritious. Sometimes when I'm feeling adventurous, I like to eat it with yogurt, either Greek yogurt or regular yogurt, and add a couple Indian spices into it and mix it up. So the spiciness of the paneer, cottage cheese, the texture like a drier, stiffer texture of the ragi roti, and the creaminess and coldness of the yogurt is match made in heaven.
