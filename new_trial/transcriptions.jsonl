{"label": "C1", "text": " To be honest, some hobbies can be a real waste of time for me. For example, collecting baseball cards is not one of my favorites because I'm so uninterested in baseball. But of course I cannot say that it can't be worthwhile for someone who enjoys baseball and likes this hobby. So I think that having a hobby is fine as long as it's not harmful to yourself and other people and as long as you're having fun with it, so it's okay and it's worth doing it."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Well, Iranians have always been so interested in having different entertainments. One of the hobbies that is popular among my friends is collecting comic books. I know some people might say that it's not that commonly done among Iranians, but it is. People like collecting different comic books, including comics from other countries. However, people like collecting other things like coins or stamps, or some artistic people or creative people might like paintings and drawings, although I think it can be an expensive collection."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " One of the other reasons that I can think of is that I find it so challenging. I see it as a challenge. Making a painting look the way I want it to look has always been a challenge and I've had some frustrations through these years but whenever I feel like that I finally made my painting look the way I imagined it or pictured it in my mind it's just great. It makes me feel thrilled and so proud of myself. So these are the reasons that I really enjoy painting. Also I really like it that I have something to hang on the walls but of course I only hang up the successful ones but I love all of my works equally. So this relaxing hobby that I have and have is great and so useful for me."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " One of the hobbies that I really enjoy doing is painting. I cannot say that I'm an artistic person, but I really like it. The material that I usually use are color, water, brushes, and special watercolor papers. I started learning how to paint a couple of years ago. Frankly, I can't remember why I decided to do that, but as soon as I knew that's what I wanted to do, I started looking for classes near my workplace. And that was when I was an architecture student. I've learned a lot through these years, and now I enjoy painting a lot. And that's because it's really relaxing, and it just gives me a satisfying feeling. It makes me feel great about myself and my work."}

{"label": "C1", "text": " To be honest, I'm almost always online since my work and my studies both can be undertaken through the internet, especially since this coronavirus situation happened.

So I can say that I'm using internet several times a day."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Absolutely, yes. It's a well-known place among Iranians, especially people who live in Tehran. I think one of the reasons is because you can do many different activities there, as I mentioned before, and there are so many things that you can purchase. The other reason that I can think of is that you can find whatever you need, and people can buy different stuff, needless to go anywhere else afterwards."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Obviously hobbies, as I said before, can help you relax and enjoy your free time. It can also be useful to take your mind off some of the problems that you might have in work problems, personal problems, and you can just enjoy what you're doing and have fun as long as you want and you can.

So they really desire to hold these celebrations with a great entertainment and with a great opportunity to introduce themselves to each other. And sometimes it changes to play up, they want to show off with their things to each other."}

For example, I'm a teacher and because of that I run my classes virtually. As a result, I need this electronic gadget, I mean my cell phone, to have my classes online. If I don't have it, I won't be able to run my classes. Also, I think it's really good to communicate with my friends whenever we want to hang out with each other. We fix the appointment through some apps in my cell phone.

So I was hoping to prove him I was capable of doing this last year of master degree and that moving to another city was worth it because it will be for my future to improve my knowledge to basically learn more about a topic I'm interested in. So in the end, I think I managed to fulfill my promise because I'm going to validate this first semester."}

{"label": "B1", "text": " work? I think it's very important because when you are looking for someone you always look for someone that you can trust and someone you can also rely on and this is part of commitment because if the boss knows that he can rely on you then you have more I would say higher chances being recruited because you show this image of someone who's definitely capable of commitment."}
{"label": "B1", "text": " Maybe wages and salaries can influence the way we are committed to work, for example. I would say that we need to be committed no matter the amount of money we will earn in the end. But maybe, yes, this can influence the level of commitment, especially with young people. Some are struggling, for example, with money issues, so it is an important criteria for them. So I think commitment needs to be applied no matter the salary you will receive."}
{"label": "B1", "text": " I guess it starts at a young age. We need to basically share with them those values because some people sometimes were not told about them. So having, for example, at school, this frame in which young kids can learn that being committed in the end is worth it. Because usually people, they are not committed enough because they think it will not work in the end. But if you show them that no matter what happens, it's worth it, then they will tend to be more committed in the end."}

I think all charities are important because they're all about helping others and making the world better. But if I had to choose one, I would choose the animal shelter in my hometown. It's called Animals Friends, and it is a charity that helps shelter, that takes care of stray domestic animals like dogs and cats. In that shelter, they receive these stray animals and they give them healthcare and a roof and food. And also they promote adoption in the local and international people."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " that are interested in that. The way they raise money is very resourceful because they receive donations from the locals and also from international people that are interested in helping animals. They make these fundraiser events in which they offer dinner to people and the funds that come out of that would go to the shelter. They also use social media a lot to communicate the needs of the shelter and they have a bazaar on the second floor of the shelter in which you can go and buy different items for clothing or books that are second hand and that's the way they carry on. I think it is very important for people to look up to this organization because it not only picks up stray dogs and cats from the street but they also take care of them. Thank you very much."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " I think people do charity for others because it's part of the empathetic side of the human heart to just see the needs in other people and just help them out with that because everybody struggles so if I receive help why wouldn't I give help to others as well."}

So to answer your question I can say that I don't really have much free time during the week these days. Right. And who do you judge?"}
{"label": "C2", "text": " have much information to answer that question because I'm not an animal lover and I don't know many people who have pets. But from what I have heard, many Iranians keep some birds like parrots and budgies, I can say. However, they are allowed to fly free within the apartment, but their owners just make sure to keep all the doors and windows closed or they may escape. On the other hand, in the past few years, Iranians have been showing some interest to take care of some stray puppies, which I consider a really nice job."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " To answer this question I can say that they can only pose a problem when they pose a threat to our safety or when they hunt the animals that we herd. What I mean is that maybe some kinds of wild animals may bite us and that can result in some injuries and infections which in some cases are considered as irreparable harm to our health. On the other hand, in my opinion, maybe they can cause emotional problems like when we have a pet and they die due to some reasons which can contribute to a very deep sorrow and sadness. I would say that's a problem actually."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I can say that it was nothing like the other wild cats I had seen before on TV. And from what I heard, these wild cats are fairly shy and they have been on the brink of extinction for a while, which is sad. And what happened that they were allowed to feed the wild cats, so I tried to do it, but the cat approached me like it wanted to attack me and I was terrified. So my sister told me that I should have been more careful because these animals, these wild cats, cannot be tamed under any circumstances. So in my opinion, that was a really interesting animal because it was different and I had never seen something like that before. So I can say that's the reason I can just explain about this animal. It was something extraordinary to me. And to talk more about that, I can say that... Thank you very much."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " So you asked me to talk about an exciting animal that I have seen. To be honest in my country we usually see cats, but we rarely see dogs roaming the streets which are not really the people's favorite, but I mean in some other countries like Canada people have the chance to see some other animals like goose, beavers, kongs or even bears every day. So what I want to say is that if I had the chance to live in a country like Canada I could name a number of animals right now to answer your question. However, I remember that I went to a zoo in Africa with my sister back in 2018 where I saw an African wildcat. It actually looked similar to a huge tabby cat, but it had a thicker tail with a very blonde tip with some black stripes."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " pet? I would say I would like to have a dog as a pet but to be honest I used to be afraid of dogs until I saw Coco which was my students pet actually and Coco changed made a big change in me and made me consider taking a puppy from an animal shelter which I haven't done yet but I have plans to and I would say dogs are good animals as a pet because they're companionable they can be house trained and they obey commands which I love."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " depends on what kind of animal we're talking about, but I can say that I like farm animals because I encounter them from time to time when I go to the countryside to have a walk. And I can say that lamping is an extraordinary time of the year and I enjoy looking at the lamps suckling up to their mother. I think mothers, I think it's adorable. And I think that's the reason why I sometimes go to my uncle's farm in the northern part of Iran to just see these animals and enjoy the nature."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I really enjoy spending time with my family, especially my mother and my sister, because it really gives me more energy after I'm done with my work or with my studies, so it really helps me emotionally.

So sometimes I just prefer to sit and relax because I feel exhausted at times. And yeah, I need some, I need to get some sleep and free up some time just to maybe be with my family. That's also something else I would like to do in my free time. We can talk with each other about the plans we have for the future. Just to, you know, it actually helps me figure out what I want to do about my life and it motivates me. And it encourages me to keep on trying as I am. Yeah, these are the things I normally do in my free time."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I think it's something that both the government and the people have to do. First of all, the government has to take some steps to just take care of some animals or establish some rules, to forbid some acts which can harm the animals or their lives. And on the other hand, we have to just improve our own culture, like the culture we have among us, and not to harm the animals. I'm not just talking about harming the animal. If we just teach ourselves to take care of the animals or just do nothing to them, that would also work. We don't need to just do something to improve the situation."}

Most of the employers are engineers or well workers, I guess that kind of technical stuff, but also they employ a bunch of people in logistics, myself included. Well besides that of course there are several other companies that supply the materials for them, so I guess it not only employs like a thousand people but it creates other indirect jobs, let's say. Well I have to say that I think it's a big benefit for the city having a company like this because of course it creates jobs and revenue to the city, they pay a staggering amount of money in taxes.

And at that time, as I remember, I had learned English for about 12 years. Because many years ago, when the students wanted to learn English, it was too long, but not like today. Because after six or seven years these days, you can get your IELTS degree and be professional in it. Yeah, I want to improve it. Because of this, I'm here. I want to test my knowledge. Where am I exactly? So if it's necessary, I think I can improve my knowledge, too. It benefits me because I think the first point that I travel to other country, I can communicate with other people easily. And I can understand them. It's one of the most important things in my life.

You know, when the couple are not committed to each other, they may fail to put enough effort into their relationship.

As a result, lack of commitment can cause downfall in a marriage and would also have a serious impact into their relationship because that leads to issues related to trust, lying, as well as other forms of damage in a marriage.

{"label": "C1", "text": " That's a very controversial topic, but I think the first step would be to teach children to set goals and start working towards it. We can teach children by helping them think of a fun goal they could achieve in a short time. For example, they could finish a book they started or complete a craft project, because little goals are the best way to get children moving forward, big goals. After that, the next step would be to develop the very important life skills called commitments. Commitment is one of those character traits that grows little by little as we encourage our kids to step out and try new challenges. So we can start it by some simple tasks. For example, getting them involved in daily household chores or having them take care of pets or working together on a big home project and teaching them a sport or an instrument or some other activities like that."}

So I think we have to make a special rule for children to keep them from dangerous content on the internet. Like using special apps such as YouTube keys.

So a leader, in this case a teacher, is there to instruct people, to teach them and to make the things difficult easy for them to understand."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " But thanks to the organization we had and after a certain feedback from different people, including the teacher, we came with this good opportunity to make this project. So just to mention, something that I really, really love about this project was the fact that we had a special guest, someone that came and was there to speak and clarify the situation. So with that we not only had the chance to get a good grade, but we also got the chance to face the reality of the happening Zarev. Thank you very much."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Okay, so I was asked to tell you about a group project that I have and I would like to start by mentioning the last project that I did actually with my classmates. It was a project about immigration but a specific immigration that we have here in Germany because of the current situation with the war in Ukraine and we're speaking about a group of people that is called Gypsies which is I think not correct to call them like that. They have their own name which is Romans and well the project was about this and I was asked to work with two classmates from my master's program they are Penelope and I think her name is Lulana. So it was the three of us working in this project we really enjoyed it and it consisted of a podcast of three episodes actually. So in these three episodes we had the opportunity to tell and explain to different people about the current situation and it was really really nice the result was amazing but to be honest we were a bit lost we couldn't find our feet at the beginning we were really lost but once we put all our ideas together we came with this really amazing idea about making three episodes because we thought at the beginning about making just one episode and instead of a podcast it will be a video."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " from my perspective and to be honest making a list helps you not only to save money but also to save your time because I think time is really valuable and since for example I'm working so I cannot be all the time shopping so what I do for example I go shopping and I try to have a chronometer so I don't spend that much time like 20 minutes and that's much"}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Yeah, we can say that, you know, because it's not a list that I write with my hands, but it's in my mind. So I like to schedule everything, like even go on shopping. And you know, a way to schedule is like to plan beforehand. So I like to make this mental list in my mind, which is like from one to 10 items. And with this, at least I have an idea of what to buy so I don't overspend my money."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " I do think so. I couldn't agree more with you because I think it is important to instruct our children about the benefits of working together. So society was built together and it will be in the next year. So I think children need to learn that."}

And it was during a Chuseok, which is like a Korean Thanksgiving. And it was a long weekend. It was a long holiday. So our family decided to go to Philippines and spend some vacation there. And we chose the worst timing to go traveling, because during that time, it was when the Philippines were experiencing a typhoon. I have a lot of bad experiences with typhoons. And this one time, we got stuck on an island, because the boats can't go back to the main island. So stuff like that. If there's a disastrous weather, I don't think people aren't going to go there as much as they usually do. Good."}

And yeah, I mean, it's definitely not a major that I wanted to pick, but I thought that because back at the moment when I was choosing my major, I guess I didn't really have a lot of choices because I didn't really know what I wanted to do. And my parents told me that business is kind of like the go-to major if you don't really know what you want to do. So that's why I chose it. Okay, very good."}

I think that I'm not really into climate change or the environment, but I could definitely physically feel that the temperature has changed, especially this winter. I don't think it was, I think it was possibly one of the warmest winters that I've ever experienced in my 25 years of life. So yeah, I think global warming is real. It's really, it's like an imminent think that we're facing. And yeah, and I don't think I could possibly recall the last time it snowed a lot. I think it snowed like twice this winter, and it wasn't even that much."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Talk about the weather a lot? Yeah, I think we do. As I previously mentioned, right now coronavirus is kind of like the main thing that's keeping people inside.

Okay."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " on people's daily activities? Daily activities? Yeah, definitely. Because we have these, I don't know what the exact term is called in English, but I'm just going to say microdust because that would be the literal translation. Actually, every, like this time of the year, every year, we have a lot of microdust that comes sweeped in from China. And as of now, the coronavirus is on the main issue, but usually during this time of the year, the weather forecast always talks about how bad the microdust is. And I think that definitely affects people's daily lives because around this time of the year, especially during spring, people would like to go out to the park and have a picnic with their families. And it's always after winter, so people are so wanting, so desiring to go out and have some time with their beloved ones, right? But like the microdust, if there is microdust present outside, people would probably want to stay in instead of going outside. Okay."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Usually when it's not as that bad, they would just let you go if it's just like a slight breeze or a small rain. But this one, when the whole country is talking about this typhoon, it's considered a natural disaster, right? So in a case like that, they'd have to go through a lot of, I don't know, discussions on the high board. And after that, they decide whether to let us go or not. So that would be like a very, very special occasion. Okay. Glad it worked."}

And I don't remember the exact day, but I know that it was Monday. I was supposed to leave on Monday, but the weather forecast, the media was talking all about this huge typhoon that's going to strike Korea that week. And our commander decided to not let, to ban the soldiers from going on leave.

{"label": "C1", "text": " Recently, recently I don't think so, but I've lived in my neighborhood for almost 20 years and probably the biggest change that, the most noticeable change that happened was that about like 10 years ago we had this, we had a new subway station installed in our neighborhood. The closest one before that was probably about like a mile away, but now we have a subway station like 300 meters from my house, so that's super convenient. Another change was that we used to have like a huge department store, but now it's like a wedding convention, so that's one downside. I think that's about it because yeah, it's a small neighborhood and it's not even like a transportation hub, so not a lot of people come, so you can't find a lot of big changes, but I guess those would be the biggest two."}

Yeah, I do like my neighborhood because, well, on the broader aspect, I live in Seoul in terms of which city I live in. But within Seoul, I live in this area called Gubanpo. And as a lot of people know, Seoul is a super populated area. I didn't say overpopulated, considering how small the city is. And despite the fact that Seoul is such a crowded city, my neighborhood is really quiet. And I don't even want to say that it's populated that much. It's very quiet. Not a lot of, I'd say, noises. And the greatest part of my neighborhood is that you can find pretty much everything, like every other block. Like say, for example, if you want to buy like a video game, like a game CD or like a game pack, you'd have to go to like a special neighborhood. Like you don't find that every neighborhood, but we have that. We have a lot of cool restaurants. We even have elementary school, middle school, high school. A lot of institutions for, you know, like private education."}

So it was like an espresso, but that was also high in sugar and caffeine, so it was something really interesting. People were super easy going, so whenever I was working in an office, because they didn't have enough power supply."}

So Ethiopia is a nation in Africa and interestingly it's the only, it has been the only independent nation during the 1800s and 1900s. The rest of Africa was colonized. So during the colony era it was the only independent nation because it was in mid-Africa and the country itself was surrounded by mountains. So it was really high ground so it was harder for western countries to just simply trespass. So it ended up being the only independent nation in Africa. So for a long time it has been the country that has been consistently there. A lot of African nations now have been divided due to how each country colonized where. So a lot of African countries suffer from civil wars there because there are a lot of tribes and a lot of organizations and religions that have conflict with."}

{"label": "C1", "text": " Well, I think that children are still young and they are not experienced as their parents or their teachers. So I feel like to answer and know to this question because sometimes they want something just for their own desire and they don't know about the consequences. Therefore like parents knowing everything they can help and they can guide them. They actually in the age that they need a hand to hold and a voice to guide. So therefore I think that children are not still able to make decisions on their own.

{"label": "C1", "text": " Well, the answer for this question would be no, because I can see a lot of tourists and what I can speak in English or try to do like culture exchange programs or anything.

{"label": "C1", "text": " Yes, actually I come from the Bukhara and it's a pretty famous city in my country because there are a lot of historical monuments and at the same time buildings.

There are some modern buildings but mainly they consist of historical ones."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Yeah, like from the question that you just said that I can feel myself, the reason is because they don't like being ignored or they don't like being rejected by the ideas.

{"label": "C1", "text": " Well, actually, I'm in a category of these kind of people, because overthinking, I think, is the main reason for having the difficulty to make a decision or come up with a decision. Because we think too much. We think about the possible outcomes and something that is not possible. So yes, that's why we limit ourselves. And some people do not want to go over their comfort zones, because sometimes making decisions means that you have to go over your expectations and everything. So that's the reasons why they do not want to or find it difficult to make decisions overall."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Well, there are some basic human decisions, like what time to get up early and what to do. They make some kind of schedules about their days. And sometimes they take the long-term decisions, like what I'm going to do in the future, or what is going to happen if I invest the stock today, or these kind of things.

{"label": "C1", "text": " And also it made me much happier and now I feel that my time isn't wasted and I don't feel pressured or like stressed out as I used to be and I think that reading books is also important for people because it always helps them to learn and get something useful and it's never a waste of time or something. So that's the reason why I think I'm going to continue doing this challenge for myself and I think yeah rather than watching movies that I used to do and it made me stressed out because I usually like look at the people and I feel like I'm just like loser or something but reading the books I'm finding out that there are like people who are having the same problems with me but still like trying to move on. Yeah, okay, that's two minutes."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Okay, I'll start by answering the question of a good decision that I made and what is it. So the decision I made was about the challenge that actually I challenged myself to read books, like three books in a month. And when I started it, I think I have to say that it was the end of my semester and that was November. The reason why I decided to read three books in a month was because I was a psychiatrist and I was in the early stages of the panic disorder. And, you know, if I do not recover from it, that will have a disastrous like the consequence in the future. Therefore, the psychiatrist decided me to do something that I really like. So I love studying and I love reading. Therefore, I decided to read books and challenge myself. And the result of it was quite astonishing. So far I have finished like six books because I started in November and it's already like two months and a half. So, you know, also I was able to get a lot of information and the things that I actually didn't know."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Thinking about it, I don't think that they are getting enough sleep. Looking at the people that I know, they're always worried about their future, because the people I know are the younger ones in the generation, and they're always worried about their studies, they're always worried about their future, so that's why they keep studying, and also they love playing games, computer games usually, so they spend all night playing computer games."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Well, I'll go for the second option, because helping. Because sometimes parents just want their own desires. Like, OK, I want my son or my daughter to be a doctor. And let's say the child is interested in some kind of arts. And usually, this is the case. Parents reject their children who are interested or talented in art, just because they think that it's not a good way of earning money in the future. Therefore, it's going to stress out the kids. And I saw, like, I read books, and I saw my friends who were pressured by their parents having, like, losing both their talents and interest in life. So I think the role of the parents is just to help and guide. It's not like they should not force their kids to follow their decisions."}

Because older people, they already have a lot of stress and the tiredness in their body. But younger people, they still have a lot of energy left in their body. So it's actually a stereotype that I have. But yeah, I think, I just think younger people, they just have more higher chance. They just have a higher chance of waking up early and being more energetic in the morning times."}
{"label": "B2", "text": " I would like to answer this based on my experience. And I personally think people that wake up early in the morning are more productive than people that get up late. In my opinion, when the sun goes, when the sun falls, it gets nighttime, everything is dark outside. I just feel drowsy. I just feel drowsy and I became lazy. It just feels like, oh, it's time to sleep. And yeah, therefore I get less productive in those times. But in the morning, the sun has risen and there's daylight. So that's why people get more energetic. And yeah, I think people become more productive at that time."}

People call me like I hibernate every day, but I had to study anyways because my exams period were... My exam periods were in front of me. And that's why, yeah, I didn't enjoy this experience, but I probably did a lot of good methods. I probably used a lot of good methods to stay awake."}

I couldn't sleep for, so I just, I stayed the night and that's why I was actually very sleepy during the exam period and I had to study for macro economics that I'm currently taking right now and yeah my methods of trying to stay awake was I ate a lot of coffee and I drank a lot of energy drink, I drank both and this is actually very weird.

These days, high school is... many people think high school is just a place that you get your degree and you finish your education to go to a good prestigious university. And after graduating university, you get a really good job and then you have a better life. That's what normal Korean people think. And because of that, high school students, they work hard and then they study until very late times, late night. And that's why people say they don't have enough time to sleep. And I personally saw some of my friends during my high school times where they just slept during the lecture times and they did their homework during the lecture times and nobody complained about that. Not even the teachers complained about that. They understood that, okay, high school students, they don't sleep that much. Just leave them away. Okay. And I do think in Korea, high school students lack of sleeping time, but even though they lack of sleeping time, they should take care of their studies and they need to take care of their time for sleeping because otherwise it will ruin their health and it will ruin their habits and lifetimes."}

But then I get used to it and it becomes quite familiar to actually work with it and to understand the ups and downs of the device. It was amazing not only because of the notifications of my smartphone that I could be aware of for using my device, but also because of the health function it has.

{"label": "C2", "text": " Well, that's a very debatable question if you ask me, because now if you look at the way generations are shaping out to be in the 21st century, it's not like the old fashioned days where we'd sit in front of a television as a family and watch too many shows. Many people like to do things individually, especially with the technology accessible, like we have our laptops, we have tablets, and just walking around with our phones and being connected to the internet. It's a lot easier to access the kind of home entertainment that many people are looking for."}

I'll call it the mother of all media, the UK, because they created the BBC, they created the BBC Radio many years ago. I think it was sometime in the mid-20th century. So I think it's very, very important. They have governmental channels. They also have lots of private channels and plenty of people like to watch these channels. You can watch anything you want. You can view movies, TV series, soap operas, but nowadays, obviously because of the internet and technology, people prefer to watch the same shows that our televisions are showing on their phones, maybe laptops, maybe Netflix, so that's a social media channel and everything. So there might be a pay-per-view and they might want to watch a certain TV channel."}

And that's where she brings people on to actually match-make people, single people, of course. And then if they pick the hidden candidate and they like what the other person is saying, then they'll choose that person to maybe go on holiday. That's the thing. They'll go on a trip.

{"label": "C2", "text": " All right, so I've been asked to talk about a television quiz show that I like very much. I want to talk about Bruce Nolan's Generation Game. So it is a quiz game, and basically it applies to families on the stage when they have a live audience. So these two groups, these two families, basically they would have to get into games and do different activities and then they'll be scored at the very end. And I always found that very interesting because they get put in situations where they wouldn't know how to, for example, make pottery or how to act on the stage, it depends what the activity is. We always watch this program. We found out about it from ITV, they were advertising. ITV is our channel three in the UK. And we just love to sit around the television and watch that together as a family. We find it most fun. So I enjoy the activities that they do. Like I said, they get onto the stage, they have to do an acting game or they'll be maybe making a painting to see who could perform the painting better than the other. And I always like the way the presenter hosts the show. He's always very energetic and the way he addresses the candidates and then the way he talks to the audience. It's always very theatrical."}

And rather than that, we can give them something positive to focus on and say, while this that you did was good, I think you should do this or kind of guide them in a certain way instead of scolding or even hitting or abusing your child, which is really important on the child's development as well.

Online just didn't shake up the industry like everybody predicted. But I think the real change is in the mode of education itself. Gone are the days where you have to go to class, take notes, memorize, come back next week and regurgitate that on a test or an exam. That doesn't work anymore. You're not training people the right way because today if you need information, there's Google, there's chat GPT and probably a lot other resources that can't come to mind right now. But information is available at your fingertips. What you need to train people about or train people for today is how to utilize this information. How well can you analyze the information in front of you? How well can you use the data that you have available to you? Do you know where to look? How well can you think through the problem to then break it down and then find the solution in the sea of information available on the Internet? How well can you do these things? How creatively can you think through a problem and figure out a solution? These are things that cannot be replaced very easily by chat GPT or Google or whatever. These are the skills of the future. Memorization and answering questions on an exam is it's not really required anymore. And I think this this shift is already happening and will really become more profound maybe 10 or 15 years from now."}

So if a child is going to be around the stove or an oven, let's say the parents are there. I think baking is very fun, especially little things like cookies that you can make shapes out of. It's like a fun activity for parents and children to do together. Baking is good on the stove too, but I think that requires a little bit more precision. So kids should bake like Christmas cookies probably."}

So that's something that I am passionate about That's also why I work a hundred hours a week on secure my scholarship So, I mean if there's a charity or a nonprofit that's committed to this cause then 100% and the third I guess Stakeholder is the universities themselves. I mean, let's let's get one thing straight right universities are incredibly wealthy institutions You look at not even your top 20 or top 30 you look at your top 200 Universities in the US in the UK they have billion dollar endowment funds that are invested into you know, some some invested into government bonds or T builds or or whatever it may be There are Billy. I think Harvard's endowment fund is 40 billion or 50 billion I mean don't quote me on that but it's it's in that ballpark range That's a lot of money from a university standpoint as well I feel like it should just be a part of their social responsibility to give back to the community that has given them so much That's what I think"}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Okay, so a job that I really enjoyed is being a speaker and a storyteller. And I love doing this job now because when I was growing up, I loved writing little stories and just connecting with people and having conversations. I never thought that I could become a speaker one day. I started my career in STEM and then ventured through 16 different industries because I didn't really know where in the world of work I fit into. But eventually I realized that all this became really useful for me to gain all the skills that I needed in communication and brought it all together in a field that I was deeply passionate about. That allowed me to channel what I really love about my work and a topic that I love, to make a difference in people's lives. Being a speaker is the perfect place to do this because you could influence people's thoughts and inspire positivity in people's lives, which is something that you could do in other places, but the impact is so much more immediate. And you are affecting people in such a big way and affecting a bigger audience as well whilst you're doing it. This is something that I'm very lucky to be able to do now. And I don't take it for granted and know that the journey for me to get here has been really long but I'm deeply grateful for being given this opportunity. And why I like it also is that to be able to connect with people in a topic that is so personal about mental health and well-being, where in some way or other we're all struggling in life.

So for that reason, I would imagine that the person would have to be very patient. And with that patience, you need to have an inherent passion for the food that you're making. I think chefs usually specialize in one or more cuisines. So just having an understanding of the background of the spices, where it comes from, of the meat, where it comes from. If you're not passionate about that, it can probably tire you out to be that invested in learning. So patience, passion, and a good environment, like access to good teachers, access to good books, access to good produce would probably help you hone your craft a lot more. Hi."}

So we really just connected and got to know each other really well during that shoot. And the unusual thing that she does is that she always wears two coats on top of each other. So, for example, some people would wear like a, you know, one of those inner coats first, and then they would put an outer coat on on top of it. But she just wears two like full blown winter coats on top of each other, which is quite strange, like I've never seen them before. So, yeah, but she always says she feels cold. So that's her method of dealing with the winter in Korea. Yeah. So that's quite unusual. But she her style in general is unusual. Like she always dyes part part of her hair red. So it's not all of her hair, but just like part of it. And then she would combine like like workout clothes, like gym wear with heels or the other way around, like a skirt and then like big sneakers.

So I learned a lot while watching this documentary because my husband used to make fun of me. Okay, why you are using buckwheat flour instead of the normal flour? When I watch this documentary, I've got the answer. And I told him, look, when you eat this flour instead of this, it will help your blood not to, how to say it, to absorb the sugar.

And then I was standing in my balcony and I saw the lightning. And I have the whole view of Dubai skyline, so I could see the Burj Khalifa, the Dubai frame. And I saw the lightning right on top of Burj Khalifa, which was beautiful. I recorded it and I posted it on Instagram. And then I saw a lot of people who were posting the same stories, but from different places. A friend of mine came over. We had a glass of wine on the balcony and then it started to rain, like heavily, rain heavily. So thunderstorm, rain. And it's just not very common to see that in Dubai. That's why I thought the weather was perfect, because it's always hot and sunny and humid. And as soon as the season starts to change, I think they do something called cloud seating, where then they make it rain, apparently. So it was very beautiful to see the rain.

So that's the reason why some people avoid making complaints. And also, they don't like the bureaucracy when they're making a refund or making complaints. So like when you usually make a complaint, you need to go to the website and find the email address or find a way to meet face to face to make a complaint. So these are the two reasons."}

Someone has specially dedicated their time to you and vice versa. Even you've dedicated your time to them. So in a way, yes, because that person could have done a lot of things in that much time. But also sometimes no, because you never know what is that person going through. I mean, in the sense, it's a friend, right? It's not a profession. Sometimes I've had my friends complaining that Aparna, it's alright. I mean, you can chill because we're just meeting for a coffee. So it's okay if they get a little bit late.

{"label": "C2", "text": " As far as I remember, I don't really have a clear memory of reading or learning history in school, which of course we did. It was there in our textbooks. But I think I grew more fond and more interested in history way later when I started reading about civilizations, when I started reading about different areas and regions and how the world was divided and then invaded by different kingships, if I can call that. So yes, it was only later that I started getting interested in history. So it says, describe a time when you were late for something. So I'm usually a very punctual person and I can't think of any time when I was really late, but there have been a few instances. And one such instance was when I got really, really late was for my work. So I'm new to London and I've started teaching yoga over here. It's been about six to eight months and I'm still understanding the tube work, like how does the commute work over here? How does the bus work over here? And also the timings and everything. So I'm still adjusting myself to the city. So there was this one class I was supposed to reach after two classes, which I was already taking in Angel. So there was this one area called Angel. I was taking two classes over there. Right after that, there was another class in another area and I was supposed to reach there. This another class wasn't mine. So I was covering for someone and I got like a last moment notification that can you take this class? And I accepted it, really vouching for it and really saying that I will be there. It was very disheartening for me because by the time I wrapped up the studio and I left from there, I couldn't make it on time. And this is a big professional setback on my end because I shouldn't be doing that. And what happened was that I went for, I thought I'll take a bus. So I took a bus and by the time I was about to reach a certain location, I realized I've taken the wrong bus. So I got down and then I tried to take a train. So by the time I tried to reach the next best train location, I realized that the train station was shut. That is when I started panicking. I started looking for a cab and I started contacting my DM, which is like a manager who's always on call and checking if you're on time or not. And the DM told me this is really sad because it looks like I'll not be able to reach on time and even five minutes late is late for students. So they started asking questions like why is it that the train station is stopped like in the sense it's shut because probably I think they weren't believing me in that moment. But later when I described everything, I clicked pictures and finally they believed me. And when I reached. That's the two minutes."}

{"label": "C2", "text": " Yes, but I'd like to put it this way, I enjoy history but I like more of the crime based histories. There are a lot of events which have happened in certain countries, certain part of towns, so I like to know more about that. I'm very heavy on crime based series. So yes, and sometimes I also like to watch just the history bit as well. Like I think I've seen that entire show on Netflix called the Roman Empire or something like that. But that's also because it's very heavy on drama. It's very heavy on the crime based as well. So I think I do have an inclination towards that."}

You also get to see the rocky mountains. You also get to see the greenery. It's very beautiful."}

{"label": "A1", "text": " So I'm going to describe a wild animal in my country, which is South Korea. So I think one of the wild animals in South Korea is tigers. They live at the zoo. Sometimes they could be found in the forest as well. I think whenever people see tigers, they feel scared, or they might think they are dangerous because they have sharp teeth and they look kind of scary. And I think tigers are going to fewer in the future because this is considered as endangered because tigers are very unique these days. So some bad people try to catch it and try to make it as their own pet. So that people think that this tiger is very special to them. So I think tigers would be fewer in the future. Ah, okay."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " A lot of jobs related to transport, I feel, will be affected. Driving, I'd say, taxis or buses. Even the flights, pilots or cabin crew, when the weather is not right, the flights might be delayed. And then if it's raining, the taxis would not be able to drive because of the water or the floods. So I think a lot of transport related jobs and even food for that matter, like the deliveries, all the delivery companies, they would have an impact in a way."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I don't think so. I think it's very human to feel a whole range of emotions. Like you can be sad sometimes or disappointed or angry or frustrated.

{"label": "C1", "text": " So the problem I had was when I was shopping for my prom dress. It happened this June because that's when the prom happened. My problem was that I didn't like the design. So there were a few options but the one I chose at the end wasn't still like my best choice. So I had to ship it early and then do some fixing myself. How I felt about the experience was that I was at first very nervous that I might not have a good dress for prom basically. Afterwards I felt that I could make some changes myself and that I didn't need to just stick to what the shopping malls had for me. I could just make it more satisfying for myself."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I can't go back that far, like when I was a child, but I do remember somewhere in school, probably towards the end of school, I loved this book called Many Masters, Many Lives. And I think I like to call myself an old soul because when I was a child, I still was very inclined towards spirituality. And I really liked to know where we come from, where would we go after life, before death, you know, those kinds of things. So after death, after life. So yes, so that's, I think, a book which rings a bell, which I always get reminded of."}

So yeah, all kinds of Asian cuisines and I also like Indian cuisine as well. Do you like Indian food?"}
{"label": "C1", "text": " There may be a few ways to deal with that kind of problem. Well the shop might have like a complaint service themselves where they can like write like a short comment on their website or submit it to their superior.

{"label": "C1", "text": " The biggest difference might be that you can't try those clothes on. I think the camera technology has evolved very much so that you can kind of feel the texture through screen. I think that kind of problem has been less of a nuisance for a couple of years.

I really like watching Netflix and I like to spend time with my husband. I also like cooking and that's the time which I get for myself.

{"label": "C1", "text": " Hmm, that's a difficult question. In the near future, I'd say no, if we're talking about like a hundred years time. Maybe, but I don't think it would be the case for like premium stores. We still want to try on kind of like the most expensive clothes before making that large purchase. And I think there is that extra bit of kind of care you can get from like in-person meetings. Sorry. When you go to a tailor to get you a suit, I think that kind of thing can only happen in person. So maybe they'd fade out like overall, but I think some of the most premium stores would remain regardless of how much technology gets better."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I think both. When the weather allows then outdoors but otherwise I'm more of an indoor person. I don't mind doing yoga every single day in my room. I know like a lot of people don't enjoy that. They need an environment, they need a setup, they need to go to the gym which is also indoors. But I do enjoy indoors and I do enjoy just exercising in my home, in my room. And that being said I also enjoy working outside the facility as well. I like going for walks, I like going for a run. So yeah, I think both."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " Online. I think online shopping malls also have a similar process of how they deal with complaints. But it might be harder because you don't have that personal kind of experience with the seller. So I think the response would be also similar to what you would do in an offline shopping mall. You can post complaints to their superiors or a representative board of that shopping company. Or you can share your opinions with other customers. I think that's much easier for online shopping malls because they require a review section so that people can have more trust in their products. So yes, I think those would be the responses."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " When you talk about exercise, exercise, I don't really exercise that much, but then I do other forms of exercise. If you can take that into the category exercise. So I like to dance. I like to do yoga. I like to go for a walk. So I'm sure that's included in exercise. So if you talk about that, I think every day, at least an hour. So, yeah, I do like to take care of my body and I do like to invest in my body."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I think this is very similar to what I just mentioned that yes, you can look at it positively as well But I did mention that I'm not very sure how will it play Financially on people but the positive side effect or positive effect can be that it can unburden or take away the burden from a lot of people and Give them more space and time to utilize in other activities of their life"}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Advantages, like I mentioned, would be that maybe they're calmer than the city children. I think the city children will be more technologically advanced, but might not have the same emotional bandwidth maybe, and might not have the mental capacity to really take in stress, because they'll always be consumed with stress around them. So I think the city, sorry I'm missing now the two kind of children, I think the countryside children will be better at having that same mental capacity, or better mental capacity and emotional bandwidth to handle stress."}

{"label": "C2", "text": " So when I was a kid, when I was a child, in school, we had a uniform. Everybody wore a uniform to school. So when it was your birthday, it was the one day of the year that you were allowed to wear whatever you wanted. So it was a big deal. I mean, at least I would pick out my outfit like two months in advance. It would be like a little dress, like a princessy frock, matching shoes, matching accessories for your hair. And then you would take some kind of chocolate or candy to school. And then you could take like a period off and go and give the candy out to other teachers and other kids in the school. And we looked forward to it every year. It was the highlight to get to not have to wear the uniform, to wear whatever you wanted, and to basically be able to skip class and go out and hand out chocolates because it's your birthday."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " It depends. It depends on your outfit, it depends on where you're going. For the day, if you're going to the office, you probably want something bigger that can fit your laptop, your phone, paperwork, everything that you might need during the day. If it's nighttime, you'd want something smaller, like a clutch, something more sleek, elegant. So it depends. If you're traveling, you'd want a much bigger bag that's able to fit not just you, but all of your family's stuff as well. So everything, women like all kinds of bags. That's why we have so many of them."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Yes, I think it becomes harder for people to make friends as they get older. I think adults are perhaps a little bit more structured. I mean, the older that you get, the more set you get in your ways, your routine, where you work, your family, your gym. For children, it's very easy for children to interact with other children. Like if you put two kids in a room and three seconds they're talking to each other without any restrictions, they're talking about all of their family secrets and everything, they're comfortable. But with adults, obviously, people tend to be more filtered when they interact with other adults. Also, I think if you've been friends from the time that you were a child with somebody, you've lived through so many life events together that that kind of bond is hard to build with someone that you meet in your mid-30s because you've just lost so much time that you're learning something, you're learning about them from scratch, where they went to school, about their family, about their relationships, about their siblings. So, yeah, I think it's not impossible. You can make a lot of incredible friendships later in life, but it's probably harder to come by than if you were a kid in play school."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " of making new friends online. I think there's more disadvantages to making new friends. I mean there was a show recently that came out on Netflix called Tender Swindler. The thing is with most of what we see online isn't real, whether it's social media or even news for that matter. Everything is kind of edited and monitored to present a certain kind of image. So if you meet somebody online and you know nothing about them, they can really present any version of reality or a completely curated, sometimes dishonest form of their reality to you. So it's a very dangerous game to play."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Hmm. Again, that's a tricky one. Now, when I answer these questions, I'm thinking back to real life situations. And in some cases, I have seen parents interfering and trying to make those decisions for their children where they were right to do so because the child was in bad company and they were too naive or too... I mean, I guess they were just too naive to see that that situation was not right for them, but their parent obviously was able to identify that my child's in bad company. So in those cases, I would say that your parents are able to read a dangerous situation better. But there's also the flip side where. Everybody kind of does make bad decisions. Your parents made bad decisions, you made bad decisions, and the way that you learn from them is to have a negative experience and then find your way out of it. So I would say that I can see certain situations, whether it's bad relationships, bad friendships when you're younger, not relationships when you're younger, friendships when you're younger. Sometimes it's necessary to have that experience so that you know firsthand how to deal with that situation. And you may not be able to get that experience if your parents always shield you from every single thing that can go wrong. So I can kind of see depends on the situation, I would say."}

We were about, I think we just turned four years old. We met obviously in kindergarten, first day of school. What I liked about her when I first saw her, I mean, we were sitting together where the teacher made us sit next to each other. She had this long hair, and it was like sectioned into two parts, and it was just braided all the way down. And she had the cutest face I've ever seen. She had this little fluffy marshmallow-like face. I guess that's all it takes when you're a kid to wanna be friends with somebody. And then I tried to, so there's like this little thing that kids do where they put their thumb out to show other kids that I wanna be your friend. And then if you don't wanna be friends with them, you do this, it's like a silly little thing. So I did this to her. I put my thumb out to say, hey, do you wanna be friends? And she was like this, and I was heartbroken. I was like, how can she not want to be my friend? And then I saw her again the next day, and the next day after that, and the day after that. And then eventually we ended up becoming best friends. She did it back to me, obviously, at some point. She was my first best friend that I ever had in life."}

I went back to Taiwan last month and I stayed for about three weeks. I was visiting friends and family, but I don't really have much family in Taiwan, just my mum. I've noticed that in life, when you don't have a lot of family, the universe brings you friends. It might sound a bit clich\u00e9, but friends really are the family that you've chosen. I've now moved away from Taiwan, but when I was there, I made a lot of very, very good lifelong friends. I go back and visit periodically. I visited Shirley, I've been friends with her since I was 15. That's about 15 years now, so you can guess my age. Tiffany, I've known her since I was 18. Cyril, Eva, I visited these friends in particular. We just pretty much, not to sound boring, we just hung out and talked a lot, caught up a lot on life, what's been happening, who are you dating, are you happy. There was a lot of that over wine or tea. I also went and visited Cyril's new restaurant. He's been doing really, really well for himself and very happy about that. We went and visited Jackie and found out that he was actually also back in Taiwan for his wedding. So we went to his wedding, had a bit too much whiskey, but that's okay. We won't repeat that experience. It was fun in general. It was a lot of fun."}

I would see this parent or this neighbor always coming in and out of their house in the best dressed suit. But one day actually their house burned down and it was like a huge thing like all across the news in our neighborhood. And basically, fortunately, nobody was hurt. But since the house burned down, they had to rebuild their house. And they took this opportunity to build this grand mansion in this tiny suburban neighborhood. There was this huge mansion with a huge fountain in front of their yard. And I was like, wow, it's quite an interesting person and quite showy and kind of extravagant. And yeah, that's what I say. And then should I just answer all the other questions? Yeah. So basically, I knew him through his children. And so his daughter and his son was around the same age as me. And we didn't do anything together much, but I would just always see him like through the front window of my house, just walking past. And then sometimes I would go over their house and play with them. And once they built their mansion, I actually got to go in and see and get a tour of their house. And it was quite it was quite like a palace, I would say. They had movie theater on the third floor. And they would love to be very hospitable to their visitors.

{"label": "C2", "text": " I actually have two pets. They're both cats. I love animals, but specifically cats. I love everything about them. So I have two cats. One, her name is Nooni, the other is Tutti. And Nooni kind of describes me as a person. Like we kind of share the same behaviors. So she's very lazy sometimes. She's also introverted, I would say. I really love cats. I love how fluffy and sometimes friendly they are. I also enjoy their company, just them being there."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " think people would react to that these days? These days I would definitely say people would be shocked at first they'd be like oh okay kind of like oh like you're a stranger I don't know you but once they get to warm up to that person definitely feel like it's a relationship that can definitely establish. Yes."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " So I feel like reading just generally could give you a timeout from everything. I would understand why people would prefer fiction over non-fiction. Because just in your daily life you're experiencing a lot of draining energies around you. So when it comes to your alone reading time, you get to experience or I guess be creative in your imagination. So yeah, that's why I think fiction books are more popular."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Yeah, I think it's I'm gonna have to say my parents because I've talked to them a lot of times when I was struggling with my current situation. For example, I remember on my first day back And I think second grade of my new school I really struggled because I was constantly reminded of my past school and my past friends I wasn't able to really focus on the current situation and the present and By talking and conversing with my parents. I was able to learn I can kind of get out of this dark spot or the slump I guess to by being grateful with what I have and Focusing on the positive parts of the current situation rather than the negative parts and yeah, so my parents"}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Definitely say in the correct countryside it's a little bit more different. Like thinking about like people who live in farms and who tend to be a lot more farther away. People would be going out of their way to greet their neighbors and introduce themselves because you know since they're so isolated they want that human interaction. They want to get to know people and then in that way they can help each other whenever something happens and just always be there for each other. Okay and how can people..."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I would definitely say that first of all, you know, greeting and then once you move into a new place, I would definitely go around the neighborhood and like pass around like cookies or give them some gifts and just introduce them and say, oh, like I'm the new tenant or new homeowner. Like whenever I need help, can you like please help? I'll always be there to help you and stuff like that."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I would say these days, not a lot of people would be familiar with their neighbors. I feel like a lot of people are more the type of people to keep to themselves than to actually be nice and, you know, go out of their way to introduce themselves to their neighbors. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Why do you think that is? I feel like in today's society, a lot of people are more wary of strangers, even if it's their neighbors. People aren't willing to be, like, going out of their way to be nice to someone, to get to know somebody, especially since there's, like, a lot of crime and violences and stories about people getting hurt from either neighbors and stuff like that. Mm."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I actually feel like art is very subjective. Teaching basic theories about art and stuff like that, I feel like, yes, it is sometimes necessary so people can understand, let's say, basic concepts such as color theory and whatnot. However, I don't feel like following a certain concept or how to draw this or how to draw that is quite necessary. I feel like your own creative mind can go in whatever direction you want it to go to."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Definitely. You know, just as I say, I think cafes are a great place to meet people, great place to meet friends, but maybe somewhere like a library wouldn't be the greatest choice. Maybe if you're planning on studying with your friends, I would say that a library would be a great place to meet friends and study together, but not necessarily to meet and talk. Okay."}

Because usually when you see pictures, you don't usually know what it's called. So when you read a magazine, where you get the knowledge, that's where you get to know, oh, this fabric is called this or this decoration is called that. So I think it's very good on information.

{"label": "C2", "text": " In an ideal world, yes, I think. The cost of quality education today is incredibly expensive and is rising year over year. What happens with that is that this phenomenal then prices out so many people from the middle class and the working class who aren't given the same opportunities. It shouldn't be that, okay, only if you can afford to pay $150,000 a year, you can go to a top 10 business school around the world and succeed in life. I mean, that's not fair. It shouldn't have to be that way. Through Secure My Scholarship, I remember there was this one girl two weeks ago who applied for an MBA in the USA and the cost of that MBA was like $65,000, which I mean, $65,000 is a lot of money. And especially when you're earning in rupees in India, that's a hell of a lot of money. Now, I mean, what's her solution? I mean, should she give up on her dreams? Should she not go ahead and do it? I mean, what does she do? She applied through our platform. We helped her get a $25,000 scholarship to bring her fees down from $65,000 to $40,000. We can't make it free. Unfortunately, we're not the government. We're not God or the government or whatever. We can't make it free, but we can minimize it as much as we can. I remember I was on a call with her and just the look of excitement on her face when she got this because she was taking a loan to go do her MBA and we effectively cut her loan by half. And that's amazing. Should scholarship..."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Back in middle school, I used to be so into books. It was basically my personality trait. I really, really enjoyed, like I had... My alone time is just spending my time reading books. And at one point, my family just told me like, get out of the house, like what are you doing? And even if I did go out of the house, like I would just carry my book everywhere I go. As of recently, I kind of fell off that habit of reading constantly because just with everything happening in my life, I can't keep up. But I would say once every two months, I would read books. What book?"}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I think I listen to music mostly when I'm driving. I think it puts me in such a good mood when I'm like out there on a drive and I play my favorite music. I'm usually into Afro music a lot, hip hop and Afro and R&B. So I prefer listening to music when I'm driving or sometimes when I'm working out, I'm at the gym, something like that."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Other than their parents, I think an important influence would be their friends. Not just because, like for example, a lot of students go to school or academia and in that process they meet a lot of friends and they hang out and spend a lot of time with them. And therefore it's inevitable that they start to, I guess, adopt a lot of their mindsets, their way of speech or things like that. And therefore it's important to have good friends, I believe, because that can change your course of life or that can change your attitude, which can really alter your future as well."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " elderly people. So like I think one important thing for elderly people to learn, though I don't want to sound condescending in any way, would be to I guess accept or I guess go with the flow of the modern society. I think a lot of people kind of get stuck in the past and thinking this is how it used to be and now we have to put that on our children and make sure they live a certain way as well. I think it's important for them to learn and evaluate the current situation and see the course of history I guess and how things are changing and kind of adopting to that and not restricting their student, I mean restricting their children in any way of saying you have to stay in this tiny little box but also allow them to try different things as well and so that's a new skill I guess for them to learn."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Definitely because I meet my friends because I want to do something with them. I want to pursue an activity with them but if I go to places where there aren't a lot of choices that I can or things that I can do with my friends and it becomes less fun I guess to hang out with my friends and so it's better to meet in certain places where there are different kinds of things we can do and different activities that we can access."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " child? Yeah, I guess the main difference would be what I was doing in those meeting places. These days I would again watch movies or eat and hang out just generally with my friends, but I would imagine that when I was younger I would go to playgrounds perhaps with my friends to hang out and that in itself the activity is different and therefore the meeting place would also have to change as well from playground to I guess popular street or a popular meeting place."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I guess throughout my life an important saying that I've learned and stuck close to is to always be grateful with what I have and go based upon it. And I learned this when I was living abroad. So I've lived in various countries and so I've always had to move around in different places and because of that I've always had a little bit of a disconnect with my friends because I had to move around. Whenever I got close I would have to change my country and so I would always, through that process I learned to be grateful, to be positive in the current situation and I learned it by I guess trying to just evaluate the situation in a more positive mindset and look at things that I can gain from it instead of the things that I've lost. And it's really important because it gave me a more positive outlook on life and also it allowed me to stay motivated to study or hang out with my friends or meet new people instead of dwelling on the things I've lost or the past. So yeah, the saying to always be grateful is what I've learned."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I dislike the addictive quality about it, you know, because so many of us are connected, you know, through a tablet or a device now and social media is our form of communication.

But I usually just take photos and send it on WhatsApp. Let's say my family group. I send it just to show them like what I've been up to in my vacation. So yeah, just photos. I would like to talk about the author or the writer that I would like to meet in the future. Unfortunately, she passed away, but the writer is Jane Austen. She is the writer of Pride and Prejudice, which is the current read that I'm reading right now. The reason why I would like to meet her is because of how during her time, which is around 1700s or 1800s, I was always interested in the Victorian or how they were in the past, the way they dress, the way they talk, especially because people in the past spoke differently. The language or the words that they used were very different. Right now, I'm reading one of her books, Pride and Prejudice, and sometimes I have to Google what she's saying. I don't understand what she wrote. It's very interesting the way she writes or the language that she uses, describing the setting, the story setting. I really enjoy it. And I would like to find out about her lifestyle specifically because again, I'm just very interested or intrigued about the idea of living in that era of the time that she was still alive. Why I would like to meet her is because..."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " No, I have not. Because I see myself as different identities throughout my life, you know, before I became a mum, during, and also after when work became something that I could express myself, you know, through. So yeah, I've had different fashion tastes, you know."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I think so. I think they do. I guess when I'm feeling gloomy and I put on a dark color, perhaps subconsciously to reflect my internal gloominess, it makes me feel probably more gloomy. But if I force myself to wear something bright when I'm not feeling so good, I think I'm able to absorb some of the energy of that color and feel perhaps a little better. Food that I learned to prepare. I'm pescatarian, so I don't eat meat. But I love food and I have a gluten intolerance, so I can't eat a lot of the Indian food. This is a little recipe that I learned how to make, which is basically paneer. We call it cottage cheese in English. It's like a spice tomato base with cottage cheese, with paratha, roti, but it's made out of ragi flour, which is gluten free and super rich in calcium and very good for people with diabetes, although I don't have diabetes. It's very nutritious basically. Together it's the perfect meal. It keeps you full. I love being healthy. I try to be as healthy as I can. So yeah, that's probably my go-to meal in the evening, because I don't have to think about... I have all the ingredients. I don't have to think about how to make it. It's kind of automatic and it's delicious, which is the most important part. It's not compromising on the taste because I can't eat salmon and rice every day. I want to eat something that's more flavorful and nutritious. Sometimes when I'm feeling adventurous, I like to eat it with yogurt, either Greek yogurt or regular yogurt, and add a couple Indian spices into it and mix it up. So the spiciness of the paneer, cottage cheese, the texture like a drier, stiffer texture of the ragi roti, and the creaminess and coldness of the yogurt is match made in heaven. So we've been talking."}

I think that people do enjoy it but at the same time it could be used as an excuse and used as an opportunity is what I mean, to employ people. Because there are a lot of people who would love to do acting but they can't really make it in the movies so maybe they could use theatre as their hobby. So I think both can go hand in hand."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Whenever I go out or step outside the house, I love taking pictures of whether it's of my friends, my family members or cats. I actually enjoy looking at things from a different perspective. So let's say just like the book on the table or the light or even just a bird from afar. I like taking pictures to show people through my eyes what I see or how I view the world."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " children learn from parents? Like I said I think students or children can learn from their parents their attitude in life, how they go about living their daily life, their mindset as well and I guess that's one of the many things that they can learn from their parents and it's really important to learn that from their parents because the parents have lived many more years than the child and so they have gone through that process of finding that right mindset or finding the positive outlook and they can kind of pass it on to the child rather than the child having to go through trial and error to figure that out on their own which is really important for the child in their life and going onwards."}

It's actually interesting because I've seen a lot of people do that online where they print out their Polaroid pictures or like a physical copy of pictures that they've taken before and they framed it.

{"label": "C2", "text": " I feel like it's such a simple way for children to build relationships. All they need to say is, hey, do you want to play? Do you want to hang out? Let's go to the playground and play tag. Or like, let's go to over to your house and like, let's eat something good. Hey, I actually bought this new toy. Do you want to come play with this toy with me? I feel like kids definitely have a better way to establish relationships with each other within their neighborhood just by simply playing and just being theirself."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " One of my favorite places to meet my friends, though I haven't met many, is a place called the Heihwaryok. I think I really enjoy that place because there's a lot of people, a lot of restaurants that we can hang out in, but also there are a lot of theaters there and I really enjoy watching musicals and plays as well. So by hanging out there we have access to different kinds of theater, plays, restaurants, whatever that we can do, making it a great spot to hang out in."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " Mostly, I think, in out-of-city areas, actually. It's mostly now as an activity that families go to with their kids, just to show a play to their kids and to introduce them to this form of culture and activity. I think it's more of that now. Theater is not as much popularized back in India as cinema and film and movies are. So I think that is kind of on the back seat. It's not so much as it used to be."}
{"label": "C1", "text": " I usually go to this restaurant called Panda Express. It is located worldwide. And the reason why I really like to go to this restaurant is for their price and many different kinds of favors. And as I said earlier, my favorite food is American cuisine, Chinese cuisine. So that's why I often go to this restaurant. The type of food I usually have is definitely American, Chinese cuisine because it is Panda Express. And also, I think I just mentioned the price alone. But as a gym rat, I think they offer sufficient proteins like beef or chicken, orange chicken."}
{"label": "C2", "text": " I don't think it will totally replace it because as I just said, there are still so many things you can't do when you shop online. So you can't check the quality, you can't check the fit. You can't, you also can't really trust all of those companies. You never know where your money will go or, or what you will get in the end. So I think there's still a lot of people who prefer to just shop in a regular store."}
